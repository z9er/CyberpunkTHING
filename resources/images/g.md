![Welcome to Night City Install Guide](https://i.imgur.com/m3rJB20.png)These short guides will have you ready to go in no time at all. Please only choose **Never Installed Mods for Cyberpunk** or **Installed Mods for Cyberpunk Previously** as both are self-contained, just use one or the other

<details><summary>Never Installed Mods for Cyberpunk</summary>
⠀

# Installing Vortex

1️⃣ Ensure that you have installed Vortex if you haven't, which can be obtained [the link below](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/1?tab=files)

[![Vortex](https://i.imgur.com/xXhkzvj.png)](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/1?tab=files "Vortex download")

# Managing Cyberpunk

1️⃣ In the main Vortex Window, click on **"Select a game to manage"**

![Vortex First Steps 5](https://i.imgur.com/MQG9vBR.png)

2️⃣ On the next screen scroll down to the **"Cyberpunk 2077"** icon and, when mousing over it, click on **"Manage"** in orange

![Vortex First Steps 6](https://i.imgur.com/n9HwYPW.png)

3️⃣ On the popup that appears, click on **"Download"** on the bottom right in orange, after this Vortex will restart

![Vortex First Steps 7](https://i.imgur.com/C9vRW9M.png)

4️⃣ After Vortex restarts, a **"Game not discovered"** popup will appear, click **"Continue"** at the bottom right of the popup in orange

![Vortex First Steps 8](https://i.imgur.com/mBvyPrd.png)

5️⃣ A window will now pop up where you should choose the folder for your main **"Cyberpunk 2077"** install directory

6️⃣ Vortex will pop up a window titled **"REDmod DLC missing"** on which you should click **"Ignore"**

![REDmod first BS popup](https://i.imgur.com/mY9T3Aw.png)

7️⃣ Go to **"Settings"** on the left, then go to **"V2077 Settings"** and ensure that **"Automically convert old style 'archive' mods to REDmods on install"** is turned off

```
This setting is defaulted to off by default unless you had changed it
```

![redmod bullshit](https://i.imgur.com/rTip1CM.png)

8️⃣ Go to **"Settings""** on the left, then go to the **"Mods"** section and ensure the deployment method is **"Hardlink Deployment"**

```
If you are on a drive that does not allow hard links due to the formatting, you may need to reformat your drive. This can happen with FAT or XFAT formatting and the only solution is changing the drive format
```

# Cleaning Vortex

1️⃣ Go to **"Settings"** on the left, then go to **"V2077 Settings"** and ensure that **"Automically convert old style 'archive' mods to REDmods on install"** is turned off

```
This setting is defaulted to off by default unless you had changed it
```

![redmod bullshit](https://i.imgur.com/rTip1CM.png)

2️⃣ Go to **"Settings""** on the left, then go to the **"Mods"** section and ensure the deployment method is **"Hardlink Deployment"**

```

```

![hardlink thing](https://i.imgur.com/iSMkrcz.png)

3️⃣ Ensure that you have removed any old mods that may be hardlinked into your main game folder from the **"Mods"** section of Vortex, and check if you have any additional Cyberpunk 2077 profiles that have mods that were hardlinked into your maingame folder. Any of this could interfere with the collection working properly due to redundant/old mods

# Ensuring Clean Game Install

1️⃣ Go to your **"appdata"** folder by searching windows typing **%appdata%**

![appdata](https://i.imgur.com/ViAyUOX.png)

2️⃣ In **"AppData"** folder go to **"Local,"** and in this folder delete the **"CD Projekt Red"** and **"Red Engine"** folders

![appdata delete](https://i.imgur.com/egu0d8A.png)

3️⃣ Go to your main Cyberpunk 2077 directory and delete the **all** folders except for **"archive"**

```
If you've ever modded Cyberpunk before, it's important to ensure you have a clean game folder
```

![Clean Install 1](https://i.imgur.com/AXG7U40.png)

4️⃣ Additionally delete the **"mod"** folder in **"Cyberpunk 2077/archive/pc/"**

![Clean Install 2](https://i.imgur.com/YW0s73X.png)

5️⃣ Now make sure you go and verify your game files through **Steam**, **GOG** or **Epic**

![amber premium](https://i.imgur.com/MiqUdnt.png)For premium Nexus users installing this collection is a one click process as below

![A GIF showing how with nexus premium the collection can be installed with one click](https://i.imgur.com/EvI4fBg.png)For non-premium users, the installation process is still simple. You just have to click **"Download"** followed by **"Slow Download"** as Vortex brings up buttons for every mod in the collection.

![A GIF showing how downloading the collection without nexus premium works, 2 clicks per mod in the list](https://i.imgur.com/6WSFDH2.png)

![green experience](https://i.imgur.com/JIJl5l2.png)Tired of the day-to-day in WTNC? Looking for more of a challenge? Give our **Cyberpunk THING** experience a try. It offers a glimpse into our brutal vision of Cyberpunk 2077. While currently in development with many features still being tested, even in its current state you're in for an engaging and challenging game.

**What's Available Now:**

- Initial rebalancing of combat and gameplay elements
- Subtle adjustments to create a more grounded experience
- The first steps toward our larger vision

**Our Vision for the Future:**

An unholy amalgamation of Deus Ex Realistic, Ghost of Tsushima Lethal, and Shadow of War Brutal difficulties. We're building a Night City with real stakes in combat

- Every bullet counts and health bloat is a thing of the past
- Combat requires strategy, not just better stats
- The world feels dangerous and unpredictable
- Your choices in loadout and approach have meaningful consequences
- Encounters are intense, visceral, and desperate

`This is an evolving project. Many of the advanced features are still in testing and will be implemented gradually. Think of the current version as a preview of our larger ambitions. If you want to be part of our test version, come by our discord`

The future is coming. Will you help shape it?

![purple upgrade](https://i.imgur.com/F4jHNO1.png)It is very important that when upgrading the collection you do it correctly. Very simple to do and here's a step-by-step guide

<details><summary>How to Upgrade the Collection to a New Revision</summary>
⠀

1️⃣ Updating the collection is as easy as clicking the **"Update"** button (Pretend all the pictures say "WTNC")

![Update](https://i.imgur.com/8UDf7uP.png)

2️⃣ When prompted to **"Remove mods from old revision"** make sure to click the **"Remove All"** button

![Update Removing Old Mods](https://i.imgur.com/8RzrQPh.png)

3️⃣ The uninstalled mod archives are left in the **"Mods"** list in bright blue, which you should delete

![Update Removing Old Mods step 2](https://i.imgur.com/OdfLQcO.png)

```
Do not update any of the mods in the collection individually in Vortex! The philosophy of this collection is that when a mod updates, we update a full revision in order to keep everything up to date and interfacing correctly; when you see a new revision, update to it. If anything special is needed we will mention it in the changelog
```
