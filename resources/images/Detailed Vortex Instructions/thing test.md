Tired of the day-to-day in WTNC? Looking for more of a challenge? Give our **Cyberpunk THING** experience a try. It offers a glimpse into our brutal vision of Cyberpunk 2077. While currently in development with many features still being tested, even in its current state you're in for an engaging and challenging game. 

**What's Available Now:**
- Initial rebalancing of combat and gameplay elements
- Subtle adjustments to create a more grounded experience
- The first steps toward our larger vision

**Our Vision for the Future:**
An unholy amalgamation of Deus Ex Realistic, Ghost of Tsushima Lethal, and Shadow of War Brutal difficulties. We're building a Night City with real stakes in combat
- Every bullet counts and health bloat is a thing of the past
- Combat requires strategy, not just better stats
- The world feels dangerous and unpredictable
- Your choices in loadout and approach have meaningful consequences
- Encounters are intense, visceral, and desperate

```This is an evolving project. Many of the advanced features are still in testing and will be implemented gradually. Think of the current version as a preview of our larger ambitions.```
