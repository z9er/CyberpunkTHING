### Quick intro for us - who are you and how did this project get started?

**z9r:** I lead the project. It started as conversations b and I had about game design and how we would improve Cyberpunk after playing it at launch. We met a modder, Teslacoiled, and we all got along so well it made sense to start a modlist. 

**b:** I'm basically the modder liaison. z9r and I had this vision of bringing together the best mods in a way where they complemented each other, which meant building relationships with the creators themselves rather than just displaying their work.

**TimTA:** I joined a bit later to handle support and planning. Once the collection started gaining traction, we needed someone to help players troubleshoot, to organize our testers, and to make sure our growing list of mods remained cohesive and accessible.

### Vanilla+ means working with the game, not against it – what does that look like in practice when you’re building a list like this?

**z9r:** We don’t have the same definition of vanilla plus that most people do. Vanilla plus to us is seamless integration and belonging. First time players should have no clue if what they’re seeing is from a mod or not. 

**Brahma:** We like to have our cake and eat it too. When you install the collection you’re given a choice at the very end: You can pick ‘Welcome to Night City’ if you’d prefer a more familiar experience, or you can pick ‘Cyberpunk THING’ if you’re ready for a challenge and want to truly see what Cyberpunk modding has to offer.

**TimTA:** WTNC still includes some pretty radical mods, but with THING it feels like there’s a lot more freedom to make even bigger changes. The game is definitely more difficult but it’s also way more immersive and way more fun. 

**z9r:** Yeah, we really do have two completely different setups in one collection. 

### Sounds interesting. Can you tell us a little more about THING, how is it different?

**z9r:** Unfortunately it isn’t finished yet, but we do have a test version that many players are helping us perfect. We were heavily inspired by some of the other games we’ve played that got it right; Ghosts of Tsushima on LETHAL difficulty and Shadow of War on BRUTAL as an example. When you raise the stakes and remove the hand-holding, what you’re left with is lethal, desperate and visceral.

**TimTA:** By adding mods like Better Netrunning by finley we are able to add more nuance, and features that were part of the game in the E3 showcase, locking down networks and adding realistic steps before you can hack every enemy to death through a camera. 

**b:** And we’ve been working with viperc48 for a long time now completely reworking enemy ai to be faster, smarter, and capable of challenging the player in a low time to kill (TTK) setup. 

Would you mind expanding a little bit on that, viper?

**viperc48:** Yeah i think the main reason for ENC and the test version of Cyberpunk THING is because most of us weren't satisfied with the gameplay in vanilla cyberpunk. Combat was way too easy, enemy variety was a downgrade from Witcher 3, and enemy AI was noticeably worse. I've always felt that the factions should have been more distinct and different in terms of abilities, strengths and weaknesses etc. Enemy abilities like sandevistan, camo and netrunning were criminally underused, and I've discovered plenty of cut content around enemy AI. It seems to me that the devs lacked the freedom to develop enemy AI and factions to their fullest potential, perhaps so as to not intrude upon the power fantasy envisioned by their management. 

While ENC was originally designed with a vanilla plus approach(meaning the same damage scaling and ttk as vanilla game), the collaboration with b for the test version of THING gave me a lot of perspective on balance and has certainly challenged me to up my game so that enemies are not only able to survive but also thrive in the low ttk environment. Enemies being able to react quickly, dodge, and even responding differently to player's actions such as activating berserk. Thanks to b, I've also received a lot of inspiration from other games such as Ghost of Tsushima and TLOU2, which are known to have a brutal combat system, and this is the new philosophy behind ENC - levelling the playing field. The constant flow of feedback from test players has been invaluable and it's been a pleasure watching experimental/WIP mods like Chipware and Better Netrunning coming together to form a fun cohesive experience that never stops challenging the player.

### What’s your top gameplay priority when choosing mods - immersion, challenge, story depth, vibes?

**z9r:** Our priority is determined by which mods get made, and we're always working with modders to assist with what they're coming up with. Our modder liaison, b, can shed some light on that. 

**b:** [Seijax,](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Seijax/mods?sortBy=endorsements) a founding member of our Merchants of Death weapon modding group, aside from making really cool [new iconic weapons,](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/15889) has added a lot of depth to existing gameplay features like [ricochet](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/7197) and [overclock.](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/14255) 

Seijax, what shapes your approach when adding nuance to these gameplay systems while making sure they still feel like they belong in the game?

**Seijax:** For me, it's all about gameplay variety and immersion. Cyberpunk 2077 is an expansive game, with a wide breadth of systems to interact with and possible approaches for the players to take, but my experience playing the game was that some of these mechanics were simply less impressive than others. Why rely on cyberware and environment to set up a ricocheting shot around an obstacle, when a similar weapon could instead simply shoot right through any kind of hindrance on its own? 

When i try to play using game mechanics of which i like the concept but i'm underwhelmed by the practical applications, i can't help but try to help the underdogs. So i explore alternative implementations, tweak, enhance and expand the mechanics in new directions, until i find results that i consider still entrenched into their starting niches, but with performances that are more in line with what players could expect out of the alternative options available to them. 

I may have started from the most obvious example, but over time i've tried to experience all the options offered by the game and found several others that could have used some enrichment (or streamlining) and went to see what i could do about them. It helps that the collection maintains an open dialogue on feedback and suggestions, as many people notice more than a few things and sometimes inspiration strikes in unexpected ways.

**b:** [Phoenicia](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Phoenicia4/mods?gameId=3333) has made mods that provide new gameplay options for players by adding [dangerous drugs,](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/14094) [illegal cyberware,](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/16031) and a whole new layer that [builds into the game's cyberware capacity system.](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/19798) 

Phoenicia, can you talk about how you approach designing mods that give players more options and how our collaboration has affected your work?

**Phoenicia:** I fell in love with Cyberpunk since watching those first gameplay trailers. Like probably many other people, I was a bit disappointed after lots of what they promised ended up being undelivered, and at some point decided to just take matters into my own hands, writing mods with stuff that I would personally feel like had been missing, or would want to play with.

Especially when it comes to cyberware, I feel like there are lots of cool concepts that could have been added that I wanted to try out. I really wanted to make sure everything is balanced, and not just straight up better versions of existing items. I'm definitely a fan of new content adding more options to the player—new items that allow players to experience different playstyles—and I'm really wary of making sure new stuff is not just straight up better than anything in vanilla.

I'm also looking forward to writing more mods that expand on difficulty/complexity of combat encounters (hopefully some of those mods will get released in the near future). Have to say, it's been really fun to collaborate with the WTNC team while working on my mods. With big mods, it's quite difficult to test everything out by myself, and this huge community was extremely helpful for gathering feedback and finding bugs in test versions of my mods before I could officially release them.

**b:** It's just as important to bring some life to the city, and that's where [Deceptious](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/deceptious/mods?gameId=3333) comes in. His mods tie in naturally to the world and feel like they could have been part of the game, whether [it's going to a bar](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/5519) or [out dancing](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/10615) with an important NPC, hanging out in the apartment with [Johnny playing guitar,](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/13779) or adding [new](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/7834) [quests](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/7833) to bring you closer to NPCs. 

Deceptious, how do you approach creating mods that make Night City more alive while still considering compatibility with other mods that are made along those lines?

**Deceptious:** Since I got started I wanted to make mods that felt like they were just a natural part of the game/world. But I also want to make mods that all work together, to complement each other! That extends to other modders' creations; it's always a shame if one mod has to be picked over another, especially if they actually offer more/different things to the player.

The WTNC project and team are on the same page! Working to make a hugely impactful collection that really expands on the world CDPR gave us, without fundamentally breaking it, while taking care to make sure everything in their mod list works well and smoothly together.

**b:** No modlist is complete without some deadly new weapons. [Misoru,](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/ogMisoru?gameId=3333) another member of our Merchants of Death, has been making new [iconic weapons](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/20073) that build on the CDPR concept but come up with new effects. They tell a story through gameplay mechanics: a [Tyger Claw weapon](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/20827) reflecting an abandoned code of honor or the [Nomad weapons](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/19234) showing their resourcefulness. 

Misoru, what's your approach to creating these weapons with unique effects while making them feel like they could be found in some hidden corner in Night City? 

**Misoru:** My favorite character in Cyberpunk 2077 is Night City. Every NPC, every datashard, every gig - it all stacks up to build this insanely deep, living world. The goal with my weapons is to add to the world in the same way, so that they feel like they not only belong in NC, but naturally expand it. "How does this weapon fit?" That's the driving question I ask with every concept - how does it fit in terms of presentation, gameplay, and world implementation? Each weapon starts as an idea in one of those areas, and is built out from there.

For example, in Tyger Cache, I wanted to add a weapon to the Tyger Claws' dojo you visit during a gig. I thought about what defines a dojo: martial arts, tradition, and honor. That last one stood out because the Tyger Claws aren't shown to be very honorable in 2077. But what if they used to be? That led to the idea of a weapon from a more honorable, possibly forgotten past. Visually, I went for a "retro-Tyger Claws" look by incorporating a blue-and-yellow color scheme seen only rarely in their vehicles, heavy weathering to show age, and a traditional Japanese pattern to tie it all together. I chose the Tamayura as the base weapon since it's an older model from a Japanese manufacturer, which fit the concept perfectly.

For gameplay, I wanted to recreate the feel of an honorable samurai duel, like something out of a Kurosawa film. But how do you do that in a fast-paced and chaotic game like Cyberpunk 2077? I settled on a mechanic where attacking an enemy triggers a "duel": increasing damage dealt to and taken from that enemy, while reducing damage taken from others - making the fight more focused and intense. Put that all together and you get Bushido!

And a quick shoutout to my personal favorite: Trailblazer from Nomad Cache. I won't spill too much other than to say it shoots fire and lightning, blows up your enemies, and sports some preem racing stripes.

**z9r:** This is just a small slice of what's happening in the Cyberpunk gameplay modding scene. We do our best to work with modders and find synergies between their mods so that our list isn't just a bunch of stuff thrown together.

### Collections can be chaotic beasts. How do you keep things compatible without turning it into a tech support nightmare? 

**b:** Cyberpunk isn't a Bethesda game modding wise and our hands are pretty tied when it comes to fixing compatibility issues, but we've had a lot of success working with modders individually to tweak their mods to play nice with others.

**TimTA:** We do a lot of QA for mods on our test version even before they're released on Nexus. Helps us catch problems early.  

**z9r:** Another thing we've learned is to not try and be everything to everyone. By leaving aesthetics up to the player and only adding mods that impact gameplay, our list remains highly compatible. We're always thinking about the install experience without Nexus premium and keeping clicks to a minimum.

**TimTA:** We have a version of our list on Wabbajack that works through Mod Organizer 2 if people don’t want to use the collection through Vortex. Our list even works through Nexus Mod App, and we’ll have instructions on how to use that specifically as soon as it has beta support for Cyberpunk.

### Lastly, would you like to say anything to the community?

**b:** We really appreciate all of the modders who've worked with us to make this modlist a reality. It's crazy to try to do two lists in one, so their support has been invaluable.
