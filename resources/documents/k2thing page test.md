# New Perks

We introduce new perks to Kingdom Come: Deliverance II. Some favorites from the first game return focused on specific styles of play and meaningful trade-offs

**Boar**
You can deplete an opponent's Stamina and Health by bumping into them at a sprint. The effect is increased if your armour is heavier than theirs

**Tin Opener**
A weapon you've sharpened yourself will cause 15% greater damage to your opponent's armour and equipment

**Night Person**
Your Stamina will regenerate 20% faster at night, but 10% slower during the day

**Tenacity**
Your ferocious tenacity allows you to sprint faster while bleeding
