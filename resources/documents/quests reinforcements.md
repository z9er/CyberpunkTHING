## Main Jobs

| Quest  | Reinforcements   | Notes   |
|---|---|---|
|  The Corpo-Rat| No  | Prologue, shouldn't have em  |  
|  The Nomad | No  | Prologue, shouldn't have em   | 
| The Streetkid  | No  |  Prologue, shouldn't have em | 
|  The Rescue | No  | Only part that might make sense is the vehicle part, and that feels annoying. rest is all inside a building where it would just screw up  |  
|  The Ripperdoc | No  | Introductory mission, doesn't really have combat   | 
| The Ride  | No  | Exposition mission, you just sit in a car, no combat | 
|  The Pickup | No  | Lots of combat, but it's all inside a building, and something tells me that it would screw stuff up. Probably have em showing up outside fighting with militech, would be nuts  |  
|  The Information | No  | Exposition quest + braindances, all inside lizzie's, no point   | 
| The Heist  | No |  All inside the hotel, no point, would probably screw stuff up | 
|  Love Like Fire | No  | Flashback scene with johnny, not a good idea  |  
|  Playing for Time | No  | Exposition quest   | 
| Tapeworm  | No  | Exposition quest | 
|  Automatic Love | No  | This is all interior at clouds, feels like a bad idea  |  
|  The Space in Between | No  | Runaround quest finding fingers. Only encounter is those dudes outside the clinic (maybe). Not worth it   | 
| Disasterpiece  | Maybe?  | This probably isn't worth it. Majority of the quest takes place in a multilevel going down building, and the only part that might make sense is the enemies outside the building calling reinforcements (and not after once they died). Probably difficult to implement well and better to not bother | 
|  Double Life | No  | Exposition quest  |  
|  M'ap Tann PÃ¨len | No  | Exposition Quest | 
| I Walk the Line  | Maybe?  | This is another situation like disasterpiece. Maybe it would make sense for the enemies outside to call, but once it's in the mall I see it being a huge mess. Unless it can be limited to just those enemies, I don't necessarily think it's worthwhile | 
|  Transmission (Never Fade Away) | No  | This is all interior (and maybe also a johnny flashback). Doesn't seem worth while at all and would probably cause problems   | 
| Ghost Town  | Maybe?  | I'm going to come down more on the no side for this. The cave... wouldn't make sense I think. The town itself, we're talking about a sort of scouting force of wraiths. Potentially might make sense for them to call reinforcements but it would probably be difficult to do, and maybe this should just be ghost style taking them out. Could be a fun incentive not to fuck up though if they called reinforcements. Unsure, probably not | 
|  Lightning Breaks | No  | Only thing you fight is some drones from the back of the truck, not worth it   | 
| Life During Wartime  | No  | I would lean towards no. Kang Tao is in the middle of nowhere, I doubt they could get reinforcements (I don't remember if this is mentioned during the quest, but if they had reinforcements, I would think it'd be via AV, not driving in) | 
| Down on the Street | No  | Exposition quest  | 
| Gimme Danger  | Yes  | Fuck yeah, screw the player | 
|  Play it Safe | No  | Would think not, considering the setting being way above the streets I don't think reinforcements would even work. Everyone is kinda cloistered with snipers  |
