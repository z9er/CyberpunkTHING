## Main Jobs

| Quest  | Reinforcements   | Notes   |
|---|---|---|
|  The Corpo-Rat| No  | Prologue, shouldn't have em  |  
|  The Nomad | No  | Prologue, shouldn't have em   | 
| The Streetkid  | No  |  Prologue, shouldn't have em | 
|  The Rescue | No  | Only part that might make sense is the vehicle part, and that feels annoying. rest is all inside a building where it would just screw up  |  
|  The Ripperdoc | No  | Introductory mission, doesn't really have combat   | 
| The Ride  | No  | Exposition mission, you just sit in a car, no combat | 
|  The Pickup | No  | Lots of combat, but it's all inside a building, and something tells me that it would screw stuff up. Probably have em showing up outside fighting with militech, would be nuts  |  
|  The Information | No  | Exposition quest + braindances, all inside lizzie's, no point   | 
| The Heist  | No |  All inside the hotel, no point, would probably screw stuff up | 
|  Love Like Fire | No  | Flashback scene with johnny, not a good idea  |  
|  Playing for Time | No  | Exposition quest   | 
| Tapeworm  | No  | Exposition quest | 
|  Automatic Love | No  | This is all interior at clouds, feels like a bad idea  |  
|  The Space in Between | No  | Runaround quest finding fingers. Only encounter is those dudes outside the clinic (maybe). Not worth it   | 
| Disasterpiece  | Maybe?  | This probably isn't worth it. Majority of the quest takes place in a multilevel going down building, and the only part that might make sense is the enemies outside the building calling reinforcements (and not after once they died). Probably difficult to implement well and better to not bother | 
|  Double Life | No  | Exposition quest  |  
|  M'ap Tann PÃ¨len | No  | Exposition Quest | 
| I Walk the Line  | Maybe?  | This is another situation like disasterpiece. Maybe it would make sense for the enemies outside to call, but once it's in the mall I see it being a huge mess. Unless it can be limited to just those enemies, I don't necessarily think it's worthwhile | 
|  Transmission (Never Fade Away) | No  | This is all interior (and maybe also a johnny flashback). Doesn't seem worth while at all and would probably cause problems   |
