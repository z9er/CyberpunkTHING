## Main Jobs

| Quest  | Reinforcements   | Notes   |
|---|---|---|
|  The Corpo-Rat| N/A  | Prologue, shouldn't have em  |  
|  The Nomad | Turn off  | Prologue, shouldn't have em   | 
| The Streetkid  | N/A  |  Prologue, shouldn't have em | 
|  The Rescue | Turn off  | Only part that might make sense is the vehicle part, and that feels annoying. rest is all inside a building where it would just screw up  |  
|  The Ripperdoc | N/A  | Introductory mission, doesn't really have combat   | 
| The Ride  | N/A  | Exposition mission, you just sit in a car, no combat | 
|  The Pickup | Turn off  | Lots of combat, but it's all inside a building, and something tells me that it would screw stuff up. Probably have em showing up outside fighting with militech, would be nuts  |  
|  The Information | N/A  | Exposition quest + braindances, all inside lizzie's, no point   | 
| The Heist  | Turn off |  All inside the hotel, no point, would probably screw stuff up | 
|  Love Like Fire | Turn off  | Flashback scene with johnny, not a good idea  |  
|  Playing for Time | N/A  | Exposition quest   | 
| Tapeworm  | N/A  | Exposition quest | 
|  Automatic Love | Turn off  | This is all interior at clouds, feels like a bad idea  |  
|  The Space in Between | Turn off  | Runaround quest finding fingers. Only encounter is those dudes outside the clinic (maybe). Not worth it   | 
| Disasterpiece  | Maybe?  | This probably isn't worth it. Majority of the quest takes place in a multilevel going down building, and the only part that might make sense is the enemies outside the building calling reinforcements (and not after once they died). Probably difficult to implement well and better to not bother | 
|  Double Life | N/A  | Exposition quest  |  
|  M'ap Tann PÃ¨len | N/A  | Exposition Quest | 
| I Walk the Line  | Maybe?  | This is another situation like disasterpiece. Maybe it would make sense for the enemies outside to call, but once it's in the mall I see it being a huge mess. Unless it can be limited to just those enemies, I don't necessarily think it's worthwhile | 
|  Transmission (Never Fade Away) | Turn off  | This is all interior (and maybe also a johnny flashback). Doesn't seem worth while at all and would probably cause problems   | 
| Ghost Town  | Maybe?  | I'm going to come down more on the no side for this. The cave... wouldn't make sense I think. The town itself, we're talking about a sort of scouting force of wraiths. Potentially might make sense for them to call reinforcements but it would probably be difficult to do, and maybe this should just be ghost style taking them out. Could be a fun incentive not to fuck up though if they called reinforcements. Unsure, probably not | 
|  Lightning Breaks | Turn off  | Only thing you fight is some drones from the back of the truck, not worth it   | 
| Life During Wartime  | Turn off  | I would lean towards no. Kang Tao is in the middle of nowhere, I doubt they could get reinforcements (I don't remember if this is mentioned during the quest, but if they had reinforcements, I would think it'd be via AV, not driving in) | 
| Down on the Street | N/A  | Exposition quest  | 
| Gimme Danger  | Yes  | Fuck yeah, screw the player | 
|  Play it Safe | Turn off  | Would think not, considering the setting being way above the streets I don't think reinforcements would even work. Everyone is kinda cloistered with snipers  | 
| Search and Destroy  | Turn off  | All inside an apartment, mostly exposition then escape from Arasaka. Not worth it | 
| Last Caress  | Maybe?  | Only part it would make sense at is at the estate, but if Arasaka reinforcements did come, might make more sense for it to be through AV not driven in. Probably not worth it | 
| Totalimmortal  | Turn off  |  All inside Arasaka tower, not a good idea | 
| For Whom the Bell Tolls  | Turn off  | All inside Arasaka Tower | 
| Knockin' on Heaven's Door  | Turn off  |  All inside Arasaka Tower | 
| Changes  | N/A  | Exposition quest | 
| We Gotta Live Together  | N/A  | Exposition quest | 
| Forward to Death | Turn off  | Potentially you could have reinforcements when you're holding people off while drilling the door, but I'm foreseeing a thing where it'd be an endless chain and wouldn't be very fun | 
| Belly of the Beast  | Turn off  |  All inside arasaka tower | 
| (Don't Fear) The Reaper  | Turn off  | All inside arasaka tower | 
| Where is My Mind?  | N/A  |  exposition quest | 
| Path of Glory  | N/A  | exposition quest | 
| All Along the Watchtower  | N/A  | exposition quest | 
| New Dawn Fades | N/A  | exposition quest | 
| Phantom Liberty  | N/A  |  exposition quest | 
| Dog Eat Dog | Turn off  | There's honestly already plenty of enemies | 
| Hole in the Sky  | Turn off  | Plenty of enemies/hard enough already | 
| Spider and the Fly  | Maybe?  |  Might be not worthwhile, but maybe in the reaching the building basement through the city to get to the spider boss, I guess it could make sense to have reinforcements callable then, but probably a pain | 
| Lucretia My Reflection  | Turn off  |  This is a mission with a ridealong with Reed, would probably screw it up | 
| The Damned  | Turn off  | All interior voodoo boys stuff, I don't think it's worth it | 
| Get It Together  | N/A  |  exposition quest | 
| You Know My Name  | Turn off  | Interior companion quest with Reed | 
| Bird with Broken Wings  | N/A |  exposition quest | 
| I've Seen That Face Before  | N/A  |  exposition quest | 
| Firestarter  | Turn off  | All inside club, mostly exposition | 
| The Killing Moon  | Turn off  | Already crazy enough | 
| Unfinished Sympathy  | N/A  |  exposition quest | 
| From Her to Eternity  | N/A  |  exposition quest | 
| Through Pain to Heaven  | N/A  | exposition quest | 
| Who Wants to Live Forever  | N/A  | exposition quest | 
| Black Steel in The Hour of Chaos  | Turn off  | Boss fight with maxtac | 
| Somewhat Damaged  | N/A  | Stealth hide and seek thing | 
| Leave in Silence  | N/A  | Epilogue quest | 
| Four Score and Seven  | N/A  | Epilogue quest | 
| Things Done Changed  | N/A  | Epilogue quest | 

## Gigs

| Quest  | Reinforcements   | Notes   |
|---|---|---|
| Dancing on a Minefield  | Turn off  | Vehicle escape mission, reinforcements would probably just be annoying in this case, there already are vehicle attackers | 
| Flying Drugs  | Yes  | It's a radar station full of wraiths guarding it, why not | 
| Big Pete's Got Big Problems  | Yes  | It's a junkyard full of wraiths, why not | 
| No Fixers  | Yes  | Wraith holding area, can't see how it would hurt, doesn't seem like there's any enemy opposition once you actually rescue the person and head to the fixer | 
| Trevor's Last Ride | Yes  | The classic wraith area, makes sense there'd be reinforcements | 
| MIA  | Turn off  | There's only one enemy and he isn't affiliated with any gangs | 
| Sparring Partner  | Turn off  | Only enemies are guards and there's only 3 of them | 
| Goodbye, Night City  | Yes  | Place full of Militech troops you're supposed to sneak in, I'd think so | 
| Radar Love | Yes  | Bunch of Militech holed up here, makes sense to have em' | 
| Every Grain of Sand  | N/A  | Just a wrap up fixer quest where you get a car | 
| A Lack of Empathy  | Turn off  | All inside the Empathy club, I foresee fuckups if reinforcements came | 
| An Inconvenient Killer  | Turn off  | All inside the 7th Hell club, ditto, fuckups if reinforcements were on | 
| Serial Suicide  | Turn off  | All interior train station, there's a tiny start top of the steps outside, but foreseeing a clusterfuck with reinforcements | 
| Guinea Pigs  | Turn off  | All inside the biotechnica hotel | 
| The Frolics of Councilwoman Cole  | Yes  | Mostly outside at docks, full of militech, militech reinforcements make sense | 
| Gas Gas Gas  | N/A  | Finished all gigs quest where you get a car | 
| Two Wrongs Makes Us Right  | Turn off  | Bunch of stairs leading down and down on a construction site full of animals, I'd expect problems if reinforcements showed up | 
| Downtown Saints  | Maybe?  | It starts outside of a church with a few enemies outside, the only place it makes sense for there to be reinforcements called is from the people outside, so if they could, that'd work, but anyone inside the church would lead to issues. It's full of scavs | 
| Prototype in the Scraper  | Turn off  | Giant skyscraper framework quest, not a good idea to have them | 
| Treating Symptoms  | Maybe?  | Vast majority of this takes place inside a voodoo boys infested spa. There's a few outside where it might make sense for them to call reinforcements, but past that, anything else would cause fuckups | 
| Waiting for Dodger  | Turn off  | All takes place inside a police station, would just cause fuckups | 
| The Man Who Killed Jason Foreman  | Turn off  | All takes place in a hotel, there's only one dude outside at the front door and he's just going to die. Reinforcements wouldn't work, even the opening is under a parking garage thing | 
| Spy in the Jungle  | Turn off  | All inside a dilapidated museum | 
| Talent Academy  | Turn off  | All insidea building | 
| Heaviest of Hearts  | Turn off  | All inside a club | 
| Roads to Redemption  | Turn off  | All an interior stadium thing | 
| Hi Ho Silver Lining  | N/A  | Finished all fixers gigs quest where you get a car | 
| Error 404  | Maybe?  | As long as the 6th street guys can actually navigate into this storage area which is open, I'd say yes. If any navigation issues then no | 
| Race to the Top  | Maybe?  | It's an open area surrounding a small factory that they should be able to navigate into easy enough, but only if the guards can do reinforcements. It's the guard faction | 
| Serious Side Effects  | Turn off  | All inside a motel | 
| Breaking News  | Maybe?  | There's a small garage with an outside area that looks to be patrolled by 6th street. I think it probably works for reinforcements to be on here, as the mission incentivizes stealth... so maybe don't fuck up, v | 
| Family Matters  | Turn off  | All inside a house, and basement | 
| Hacking the Hacker  | Turn off  | All inside a building | 
| Cuckoo's Nest  | Turn off  | All inside a hospital except a small section at the very end in parking lot, not worth it | 
| Severance Package  | Turn off  | While it starts outside with like 2 people guarding, most is inside, I don't think worthwhile | 
| Desperate Measures  | Turn off  | Quest is inside, then has vehicle pursuit scripted, probably not worth messing with | 
| For My Son  | Turn off  | All inside the animals boxing club | 
| Going-away Party  | Yes  | Lotta 6th streeters outside of a house, while some takes place inside, I can only see reinforcements making things more lively | 
| Ride Captain Ride  | N/A  | Finished all fixers gigs quest where you get a car | 
| Hippocratic Oath  | Yes  | I think the maelstrom calling reinforcements would only be more interesting | 
| Many Ways to Skin a Cat  | Yes  | It's an inside/outside garage, so more tyger claws seems fine long as they can get through or at least shoot through the gate, which I believe they can | 
| Monster Hunt  | Turn off | Id' side with no, it's in a multi story club, there's already some automatic reinforcements at the end of the quest. Probably not worth fuckups | 
| Playing for Keeps  | Yes  | If you went guns blazing, I'd think the claws would be calling on you and it'd get interesting | 
| Rite of Passage  | Maybe?  | While this is mostly inside a building, I could see it being interesting if reinforcements were called. They might come in, but even if they were waiting outside, pretty cool | 
| Dirty Biz  | Yes  | More Maelstrom is fun, they might come in or might not, but they'd enliven things | 
| Troublesome Neighbors  | Turn off  | It's all some windy path bullshit to even get there, not worth it | 
| Welcome to America, Comrade  | Yes  | They might get hooked on the gate, but I think reinforcements would be cool here if they spawn right | 
| Backs Against the Wall  | Turn off  | All inside a building, it's just one unaffiliated dude | 
| Catch a Tyger's Toe  | Turn off  | All inside the basement of a building | 
| Woman of La Mancha  | Yes  | As long as the tygers could get there from outside at the kabuki ring thing, I think it's fine. I imagine it'd work | 
| Flight of the Cheetah  | Yes  | If they tygers can get into the motel area ok generally, this seems fine | 
| Shark in the Water  | Turn off  | All in a building, and there's already some reinforcements built in |

| Small Man, Big Evil  | Turn off  | This is all on rooftops, can foresee nothing but trouble | 
| Bloodsport | Turn off | Small gated area and in a building, foreseeing issues | 
| Scrolls before Swine  | Yes  | I think the maelstromers would make things interesting enough, most of this is outside a small warehouse | 
| Freedom of the Press  | N/A  | All inside, it's just turrets | 
| Lousy Kleppers  | Yes  | All outside a warehouse, why not more maelstrom | 
| Fixer, Merc, Soldier, Spy  | Turn off  | Almost all at the top of a building | 
| The Heisenberg Principle  | Turn off  | Almost all inside a multi floor basement thing interior, has built in reinforcement at the end | 
| Occupational Hazard | N/A  | It's one cyberpsycho in an interior |

| Family Heirloom | Turn off | All inside a parking garage | 
| Hot Merchandise  | Turn off  | All inside a store | 
| Nasty Hangover  | Maybe?  | Lotta 6th street outside a warehouse with a big entrance, I think it would work. Wouldn't let the small group of Kang Tao at the end call reinforcements though |

| Fifth Column  | Turn off  | All inside a building | 
| Jeopardy  | Turn off  | All inside a funeral home |
