| Quest  | Reinforcements   | Notes   |
|---|---|---|
|  The Corpo-Rat| No  | Prologue, shouldn't have em  |  
|  The Nomad | No  | Prologue, shouldn't have em   | 
| The Streetkid  | No  |  Prologue, shouldn't have em | 
|  The Rescue | No  | Only part that might make sense is the vehicle part, and that feels annoying. rest is all inside a building where it would just screw up  |  
|  The Ripperdoc | No  | Introductory mission, doesn't really have combat   | 
| The Ride  | No  | Exposition mission, you just sit in a car, no combat | 
|  The Pickup | No  | Lots of combat, but it's all inside a building, and something tells me that it would screw stuff up. Probably have em showing up outside fighting with militech, would be nuts  |
