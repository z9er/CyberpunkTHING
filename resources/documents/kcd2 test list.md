| Mod Name  | What It Does   | Notes   |
|---|---|---|
|  [Bad Reputation](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/1859)| Sets the starting reputation of all locations lower when you're at the beginning of game, makes sense in context and should help things feel a bit less like you immediately becoming rich and beloved sans perks  | Should it be bad or very bad for the file? Get feedback  |  
|  [Alternate Combat 1.0](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/2497) | Removes the limitations for targeting in group combat when not locked on, made by Mordhau's gameplay designer guy  | It is very finnicky for minor movements translating to sword direction in hardcore mode. This is a new mod, now is the time to give any feedback to the mod author   | 
| [Matt's Longer Books](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/866)  | Makes books take longer to study, can increase xp gained from doing so if it's much (5x) longer  | Idea is good, but does it work on newest version of game, and which version to go with, does it make sense to increase xp the same amount as the duration to study is increased? Scholarship is a relatively hard thing to level but... is it too easy then? | 
|  [Smooth Cutscenes 1.2](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/425) | Matches cutscene fps to your ingame fps settings  | Does this work on current version of the game?  |  
|  The Ripperdoc | N/A  |    | 
| The Ride  | N/A  |  | 
|  The Pickup | Turn off  |   |
