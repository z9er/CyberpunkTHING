| Mod Name  | What It Does   | Notes   |
|---|---|---|
|  [Bad Reputation](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/1859)| Sets the starting reputation of all locations lower when you're at the beginning of game, makes sense in context and should help things feel a bit less like you immediately becoming rich and beloved sans perks  | Should it be bad or very bad for the file?

|  [Alternate Combat 1.0](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/2497) | Removes the limitations for targeting in group combat when not locked on, made by Mordhau's gameplay designer guy  | It is very finnicky for minor movements translating to sword direction in hardcore mode. This is a new mod, now is the time to give any feedback to the mod author   |
