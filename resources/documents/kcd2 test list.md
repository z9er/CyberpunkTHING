### So what's the point of this?

Just adjusting to something I'd like playing. Trying to make things a little more challenging, a bit more dynamic in how NPCs react, and to make the combat more fun to do with less strictures on targeting (with the addition of still being able to lock on fine) and have the game "work" without having to disable a mod or some dumb shit like that at some part of the game, and to have it all work in hardcore mode (which I love)

### Actual Mods for the Thing

| Mod Name  |  Author | What It Does   | Notes   | PTF |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  [Bad Reputation](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/1859)| hwkdev | Sets the starting reputation of all locations lower when you're at the beginning of game, makes sense in context and should help things feel a bit less like you immediately becoming rich and beloved sans perks  | Should it be bad or very bad for the file? Get feedback  | No | 
|  [Alternate Combat 1.0](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/2497) | crush | Removes the limitations for targeting in group combat when not locked on, made by Mordhau's gameplay designer guy  | It is very finnicky for minor movements translating to sword direction in hardcore mode. This is a new mod, now is the time to give any feedback to the mod author   | No |
| [Matt's Longer Books](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/866)  | Matdir | Makes books take longer to study, can increase xp gained from doing so if it's much (5x) longer  | Idea is good, but does it work on newest version of game, and which version to go with, does it make sense to increase xp the same amount as the duration to study is increased? Scholarship is a relatively hard thing to level but... is it too easy then? | Yes |
|  [Smooth Cutscenes 1.2](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/425) | zhiletka | Matches cutscene fps to your ingame fps settings  | Does this work on current version of the game?  |  No |
|  [Easy To See Herbs II 3.0](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/457) | Lucas182 | Makes a few plants easier to distinguish, it's night and day, made by a UI obsessive designer dude  |  Work on latest version? Seems like it would  | No |
| [Rain Lighting Fix 1.0.1](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/2077)***  | Khena123 | Properly fixes the bright rain at night  |  | No |
|  [Realish Horse Armor 1.0](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/1449) | Actalo | Makes horse armor more effective, buffs a niche playstyle which you get dehorsed at the drop off a hat even at high courage for the horse, use the vanilla scaling one  |  Does it work on latest version? |  Yes |
|  [Realish Prostitution 1.0.0](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/2290) | Actalo | Differentiates the bath houses offering prostitution depending on location and how "official" they are, makes sense, makes for it being more nuanced than all providing the same services/buff  |  Does this work on latest version of game?  | No |
| [Realish Poisons 1.20](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/1830)  | Actalo | Addes downsides and upsides to some of the poisons, particularly bane. Instead of being an instant kill, it frenzies enemies so as they're dying (if you inject it rather than them digesting the poison) they go ape mode and try even harder to murder you on their way out. Fun balance idea honestly, I like it a lot |  Does it work on newest version of the game? | Yes |
|  [Realish Stealth 2.00](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/1970) | Actalo | Makes NPCs more wary and makes stealth more difficult in ways that make sense and don't feel gamey, also removes about half the stealth perks which were "RPG" bullshit, per author: "Many perks really are trash RPG band-aids that lose their modicum of value after Henry hits about 20 in that skill. That or they're functionally 'cheats'. Why even use a mod that makes Stealth challenging if you're just gonna select a bunch of perks that make Stealth easy? I'm sorry, but I just don't understand your line of reasoning."  | Work on newest version of game?  |  Yes |
|  [Realish NPCs 1.50](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/1778) | Actalo | NPCs have increased reactivity to Henry's behavior, other adjustments like them always praying outloud to help in stealth, better at gambling, changes to reputation on haggling, changes to crime threshholds, less tolerance to tresspass and whatnot  |    | Yes |
| [Realish Enemies 1.80](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/1631)  | Actalo | General combat changes for NPCs, makes them behave differently, sprint to reposition in combat, react faster, flank more, etc etc  |   | Yes |
|  [Realish Wounds 2.60](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/1393) | Actalo | Changes to injuries, bleeding, recoverty times, healing  |   |  Yes |
|  [Realish Hunting 4.00](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/1593) | Actalo | Different animal spawning, behavior, wound system, more challenge to hunting, how they react to sightlines, smell, etc  |    | No |
| [Realish Tournaments 1.40](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/2062)  | Actalo | Overhaul of the tournament and during the quest, makes other fighters better equipped, more varied equipment, etc |   | Yes |
|  [Realish Speed 2.23](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/1432) | Actalo | Removes slo-mo, changes to attack speed with nuance between Henry and opponents  | Does this break anything?  |  No |
|  [Realish Techniques 1.51](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/2346) | Actalo | Gives an actual reason to use polearms or longsword  |  "There is a rare knockout event that can occur when Henry is knocked out, revived, then speaks to guards, then tries to fight again, and if he's knocked out again (from a weapon), there could be an endless loading screen." How common? Worth it?  | Yes |
| [Polearm Clinch Attacks ](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/582)  | machinegod | Allows polearms to be used in a clinch | Does the animation look buggy as shit since it uses mace anims? Can you still do the Tomcat master strike quest? Does it interfere with master strikes or combos with other weapons? Does it work on newest version of game?  | No |
|  [Polearm Recipes - PTF 1.4](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/419) | machinegod | Adds formerly not existing polearm schematics to some vendors  |  Does this still work? Any downside?  | Yes |

| [Miscellaneous Mods - Boomstick 1.01](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/2233)  | Actalo | Change to guns |  Is this working? They mention Handgonne Overhaul but it isn't listed anywhere | Yes |
| [Miscellaneous Mods - ImmersiveBoltArrow 1.01](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/2233)  | Actalo | RWA like system without RWA, scaled up for vanilla damage |  Does this still work on newest version of the game? | Yes |

### Interesting Perk Mods 

Would only bother with these if they were able to add in even if the perk list was already adjusted (like by real stealth or something). Also, it would be nice if a level could be added to them for use. Maybe not though, they're mostly pro with con perks

### Why Some Stuff Isn't Included

#### Camping

Feels redundant when there's already many campsites around, and it takes away from the "home" feeling of rented inns or beds you've earned that you can save at

[The KCD2 Camping Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/1927)

#### Weapon and Armor Changes

Still unsure about them. Still pondering. It's so difficult to implement such a thing cohesively. 

[Realish Weapons and Armor](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/1237)

#### Economy Changes

Still thinking through, it's so hard to cohesively implement, there's a million items. Real economy looks good, but... decisions decisions
