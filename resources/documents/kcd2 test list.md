### So what's the point of this?

Just adjusting to something I'd like playing. Trying to make things a little more challenging, a bit more dynamic in how NPCs react, and to make the combat more fun to do with less strictures on targeting (with the addition of still being able to lock on fine) and have the game "work" without having to disable a mod or some dumb shit like that at some part of the game, and to have it all work in hardcore mode (which I love)

### Actual Mods for the Thing

| Mod Name  | What It Does   | Notes   |
|---|---|---|
|  [Bad Reputation](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/1859)| Sets the starting reputation of all locations lower when you're at the beginning of game, makes sense in context and should help things feel a bit less like you immediately becoming rich and beloved sans perks  | Should it be bad or very bad for the file? Get feedback  |  
|  [Alternate Combat 1.0](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/2497) | Removes the limitations for targeting in group combat when not locked on, made by Mordhau's gameplay designer guy  | It is very finnicky for minor movements translating to sword direction in hardcore mode. This is a new mod, now is the time to give any feedback to the mod author   | 
| [Matt's Longer Books](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/866)  | Makes books take longer to study, can increase xp gained from doing so if it's much (5x) longer  | Idea is good, but does it work on newest version of game, and which version to go with, does it make sense to increase xp the same amount as the duration to study is increased? Scholarship is a relatively hard thing to level but... is it too easy then? | 
|  [Smooth Cutscenes 1.2](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/425) | Matches cutscene fps to your ingame fps settings  | Does this work on current version of the game?  |  
|  [Easy To See Herbs II 3.0](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/457) | Makes a few plants easier to distinguish, it's night and day, made by a UI obsessive designer dude  |  Work on latest version? Seems like it would  | 
| [Rain Lighting Fix 1.0.1](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/2077)  | Properly fixes the bright rain at night  |  | 
|  [Realish Horse Armor 1.0](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/1449) | Makes horse armor more effective, buffs a niche playstyle which you get dehorsed at the drop off a hat even at high courage for the horse, use the vanilla scaling one  |  Does it work on latest version? |  
|  [Realish Prostitution 1.0.0](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/2290) | Differentiates the bath houses offering prostitution depending on location and how "official" they are, makes sense, makes for it being more nuanced than all providing the same services/buff  |  Does this work on latest version of game?  | 
| [Realish Poisons 1.20](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/1830)  | Addes downsides and upsides to some of the poisons, particularly bane. Instead of being an instant kill, it frenzies enemies so as they're dying (if you inject it rather than them digesting the poison) they go ape mode and try even harder to murder you on their way out. Fun balance idea honestly, I like it a lot |  Does it work on newest version of the game? | 
|  [Realish Stealth 2.00](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/1970) | Makes NPCs more wary and makes stealth more difficult in ways that make sense and don't feel gamey, also removes about half the stealth perks which were "RPG" bullshit, per author: "Many perks really are trash RPG band-aids that lose their modicum of value after Henry hits about 20 in that skill. That or they're functionally 'cheats'. Why even use a mod that makes Stealth challenging if you're just gonna select a bunch of perks that make Stealth easy? I'm sorry, but I just don't understand your line of reasoning."  | Work on newest version of game?  |  
|  [Realish NPCs 1.50](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/1778) | NPCs have increased reactivity to Henry's behavior, other adjustments like them always praying outloud to help in stealth, better at gambling, changes to reputation on haggling, changes to crime threshholds, less tolerance to tresspass and whatnot  |    | 
| [Realish Enemies 1.80](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/1631)  | General combat changes for NPCs, makes them behave differently, sprint to reposition in combat, react faster, flank more, etc etc  |   | 
|  [Realish Wounds 2.60](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/1393) | Changes to injuries, bleeding, recoverty times, healing  |   |  
|  [Realish Hunting 4.00](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/1593) | Different animal spawning, behavior, wound system, more challenge to hunting, how they react to sightlines, smell, etc  |    | 
| [Realish Tournaments ](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/2062)  | Overhaul of the tournament and during the quest, makes other fighters better equipped, more varied equipment, etc |   | 
|  [Realish Speed 2.23](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/1432) | Removes slo-mo, changes to attack speed with nuance between Henry and opponents  | Does this break anything?  |  
|  [Realish Techniques 1.51](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/2346) | Gives an actual reason to use polearms or longsword  |  "There is a rare knockout event that can occur when Henry is knocked out, revived, then speaks to guards, then tries to fight again, and if he's knocked out again (from a weapon), there could be an endless loading screen." How common? Worth it?  | 
| [Polearm Clinch Attacks ](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/582)  | Allows polearms to be used in a clinch | Does the animation look buggy as shit since it uses mace anims? Can you still do the Tomcat master strike quest? Does it interfere with master strikes or combos with other weapons? Does it work on newest version of game?  | 
|  [Polearm Recipes - PTF 1.4](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/419) | Adds formerly not existing polearm schematics to some vendors  |  Does this still work? Any downside?  | 
| [Miscellaneous Mods - BetterHeadshot 1.0](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/2233)  | Increases head-shot multiplier from 1.5x to 2x |  Does this still work on newest version of the game? | 
| [Miscellaneous Mods - Boomstick 1.01](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/2233)  | Change to guns |  Is this working? They mention Handgonne Overhaul but it isn't listed anywhere |
| [Miscellaneous Mods - ImmersiveBoltArrow 1.01](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/2233)  | RWA like system without RWA, scaled up for vanilla damage |  Does this still work on newest version of the game? | 
| [Maniac Mutt 1.22](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/2432)  | Overhauls Mutt's morale system, stats, abilities, and greatly improves his combat effectiveness |   | 
|  [Realish Warhorses 1.15](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/1594) | With this mod, mounted combat can be devastatingly effective. Horse courage and stamina now scales better with rider skill, enemies have difficulty unseating rider, horses shy less around enemies or canines, and melee attacks from horseback deal significantly more damage  |    | 
| [Better Allies ](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/2524)  | Greatly increases the individual combat effectiveness of Henry's core allies |   | 
|  [The KCD2 Cooking Mod 1.5](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/1578) | complex recipe system, complete with 50+ unique new recipes, cooking items and immersive roleplay elements  |   |  
|  [Immersive Faster Animations 1.1](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/902) | Alchemy animations are sped up by 50% where applicable, mainly while interacting with ingredients. The finishing animations are sped up by 25%.  | Any issues from this? Is it janky? Does it cause problems with fast cooking or doing shortcuts?   | 
|  [Pebbles and Herring Perk Nerf Half 1.0](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/2384) | Nerfs the Good Ole Pebbles and Red Herring perks so you might wind up using a different horse instead of the first one all game  |    |
|  [Stolen Sort 1.3](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/1262) | Adds a new button to sort items by stolen status  |    |
|  [The KCD2 Nutrition Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/1903) | More consequences around properly managing a reasonably balanced medieval diet. Maintain your fruits, vegetables, protein, and hydration  |  Unsure what combination of the files to use  |

### Mods I'm Thinking About Generally but Unsure On

| Mod Name  | What It Does   | Notes   |
|---|---|---|
|  [Immersive talk 1.2](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/1809) | Hides the notification about the result of the skill check, the notification about the player's reputation and the skills in the dialog  |  Probably too hardcore, shouldn't bother  |
|  [High FPS FX 1.2](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/2404) | Frame rates for all particle effects are increased with a 60 FPS cap  |  Might be causing an issue with smoke, from one of the comments. Unsure  |

### Interesting Perk Mods 

Would only bother with these if they were able to add in even if the perk list was already adjusted (like by real stealth or something). Also, it would be nice if a level could be added to them for use. Maybe not though, they're mostly pro with con perks

### Why Some Stuff Isn't Included

#### Economy shit:

The economy mods I see are not cohesively implemented and it's such a massive game it doesn't seem like there's much point to adjusting that when you could just adjust the ways of accumulating stuff to be more difficult (stealth, combat) instead. Even the comments on the pages from the modders show that it is a terrible effort to try to go to for "realism" and honestly, it just isn't worth touching imo

[Realish Economy](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/1646)
[Inflation - Increased Buy Price (PTF)](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/804)
[Reduced Sell Price (PTF)](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/586)

#### Camping

Feels redundant when there's already many campsites around, and it takes away from the "home" feeling of rented inns or beds you've earned that you can save at

[The KCD2 Camping Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/1927)

#### Weapon and Armor Changes

Similar to the economy mods, it feels like it just jumbles stuff up more. Reminds me of adjustments made for "lore" or "realism" in skyrim where some mods would try to shift tiers of weapons around to be more appropriate, where the more logical thing is to just role with the way the game is and not try to go against the current so much
