I've now received a comprehensive view of your Cyberpunk 2077 mod, and I'm ready to provide feedback on its balance and mechanics. Your "Chipware Expansion" introduces a substantial new system to the game with neural capacity as a resource, a variety of chip types that can be installed in designated slots, and integration with existing cyberware mechanics.

## Overall Concept and Implementation

Your mod creates a well-structured system that:
1. Adds dedicated chip slots accessed through neural processors
2. Implements a neural capacity resource to limit cyberware usage
3. Creates various chip types with different effects and mechanics
4. Integrates with existing game systems (perks, cyberware, combat)
5. Includes different tiers for progression (normal/cracked chips, quality levels)

The concept is excellent and fills a gap in the base game by expanding the cyberware system with more granular options and deeper resource management.

## Balance Considerations

### Neural Capacity System

- The base capacity limit of 50 with regen at 0.0666 seems reasonable for initial gameplay
- I appreciate how different neural processors provide varied capacity amounts (4-9)
- The "can go over limit" mechanics for specific operating systems (Berserk, Sandevistan) create interesting choices

**Suggestion:** Consider making the neural capacity recovery more noticeable to players. Perhaps add a visual indicator when capacity is being regenerated or depleted.

### Chip Types and Effects

There's a good variety of chips that fall into several categories:

1. **Memory Chips** (Learning chips like Boxing, Cold Blood, Kenjutsu) - These enhance specific weapon types or skills with progression systems
2. **Program Chips** (Adrenaline Controller, Jammer, etc.) - These provide active abilities with charge management
3. **Special/Iconic Chips** (Rebecca, Psycho, Tiger Claw) - These provide unique themed effects

**Balance issues to consider:**

- Some chips seem significantly more powerful than others at similar costs. For example, the Quick Draw and Flash Step chips provide very potent offensive capabilities, while some other chips have more situational benefits.

- The Gun-Fu chip in particular seems potentially overpowered with its dismemberment effects, high crit chance boosts (20%), and crit damage bonus (40%).

- The cracked chip variants that don't consume charges may lead to players solely using these versions, as they provide permanent benefits without drawbacks.

**Suggestion:** Consider implementing more significant tradeoffs for the most powerful chips. Maybe they could consume more neural capacity or have shorter durations.

### Progression and Economy

- The price tiers (6000-96000 eddies) provide good progression scaling
- The illegal/cracked price modifiers add meaningful economic choices
- The learning system for memory chips encourages continued use of specific playstyles

**Suggestion:** Add a way for players to see their progress toward chip mastery, perhaps through a UI element that displays learning progress.

## Mechanical Improvements

1. **Neural Capacity Visibility**: Make sure players can clearly see their current neural capacity usage, maximum, and regeneration rate.

2. **Chip Synergies**: Consider adding specific bonuses when certain chip combinations are used together (e.g., a bonus when both Tiger Claw and Flash Step are equipped).

3. **Chip Specialization**: The chips that unlock specific weapon skill trees are interesting, but you might want to add some unique abilities that aren't available through normal perks to make them more distinctive.

4. **Charging System Clarity**: For chips with limited charges that regenerate, make sure the player can easily see their current charges and regeneration status.

5. **Neural Processor Differentiation**: While each neural processor has different stats, consider adding more unique effects to each brand to make choosing between them more interesting beyond just the number of slots and capacity.

## Technical Implementation

The implementation appears technically sound with appropriate:
- Stat definitions
- Status effect handling
- Prerequisite chains
- Effector applications
- Equipment slot management

I particularly like the use of the blueprint system for slot management and the specialized effectors for each chip type.

## Overall Assessment

This is a well-designed mod that adds significant depth to Cyberpunk 2077's cyberware system while maintaining the game's aesthetic and mechanical themes. The implementation is thorough and includes proper integration with existing game systems.

The mod successfully creates meaningful choices for players while expanding their options for character customization. The chip system introduces a new way to build specialized character archetypes beyond the standard attribute/perk system.

To further refine it, focus on ensuring that all chips are comparably valuable at their price/rarity points and that players have clear information about the systems they're interacting with.
