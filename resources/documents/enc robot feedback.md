I'll analyze the issues and proposed fixes noted at the end of the file. Let me break this down into categories:

**Core Combat Issues & Solutions:**

1. Blocking/Defense Issues:
```lua
--enemies invincible even when not in blocking anim, probably because of blockstate
--enemies with fists block way more often than parry, katana enemies can parry
```
Solutions:
- Implement state validation to ensure block state matches animation
- Add timer-based checks to force state exit
- Rebalance block/parry probability based on weapon type
- Consider adding stamina cost to blocking to prevent spam

2. Movement/Positioning Problems:
```lua
--enemies stuck in cover, dont come out
--snipers way too static in cover, they keep peeking but dont exit cover
--enemies keep peeking and remain in cover if shooting cond not met
--shotgunners with sandy dashshoot dont catchup as well as those without
```
Solutions:
- Add timeout conditions to force cover exit
- Implement dynamic range thresholds for different weapon types
- Add "stuck detection" with forced repositioning
- Create separate movement profiles for different weapon/ability combinations

3. Animation/State Glitches:
```lua
--netrunner getting interrupted when player close still has animation bug
--melee combo sprint to target might need dynamictargetupdatetimer
--enemies stuck in shooting action if blocked by squadmate
```
Solutions:
- Add animation interruption cleanup
- Implement better squad mate collision awareness
- Add position validation before animation commitment
- Create recovery states for interrupted animations

4. AI Decision Making Issues:
```lua
--handgun smg should be close range. Smart weapon tech precision rifle far range
--problem with removing limit for close ring is that enemies may bunch up
--enemies dont circle/strafe very far during strafe evade
```
Solutions:
- Implement weapon-specific positioning logic
- Add spacing awareness between squad members
- Create dynamic strafe distances based on weapon type
- Add group coordination for positioning

**Technical Optimizations:**

1. Performance Improvements:
```lua
--catchupdistance need to take personality into account
--shooting actions need to have a timeout if player cant be shot at
```
Implementation suggestions:
```lua
-- Example personality-based distance calculation
local function calculateCatchupDistance(npc)
    local baseDistance = 10
    local personalityMod = {
        defensive = 1.5,
        aggressive = 0.7,
        cautious = 1.2
    }
    local healthMod = npc.currentHealth / npc.maxHealth
    return baseDistance * personalityMod[npc.personality] * healthMod
end

-- Example timeout system for shooting actions
local function shouldTimeoutShooting(npc)
    return npc.lastSuccessfulShot + 5.0 < currentTime() and 
           not hasLineOfSight(npc, target)
end
```

2. AI Behavior Enhancements:
```lua
--npcs shouldnt catchup sprint if player is visible and looking
--rangedavoidlos should have timeout and consider personality
```
Implementation suggestions:
```lua
-- Example visibility check for sprint decisions
local function shouldSprintCatchup(npc, player)
    return not isVisible(player, npc) or 
           not isLookingAt(player, npc) or 
           getDistance(player, npc) > 20
end

-- Example personality-based timeout system
local function calculateAvoidTimeout(personality)
    local baseTime = 3.0
    local modifiers = {
        aggressive = 0.5,
        defensive = 2.0,
        cautious = 1.5
    }
    return baseTime * modifiers[personality]
end
```

**Feature Enhancements:**

1. Grenade/Special Ability Management:
```lua
--npcs shouldnt throw certain grenades if target has immunity
--somehow androids can throw nades without having that ability
```
Solution outline:
```lua
-- Example immunity check system
local function canUseGrenade(npc, target, grenadeType)
    if not npc.abilities.throwGrenade then return false end
    
    local immunities = getTargetImmunities(target)
    local grenadeEffects = getGrenadeEffects(grenadeType)
    
    return not hasOverlap(immunities, grenadeEffects)
end
```

2. NPC Type Specific Improvements:
```lua
--convert named npcs from ncpd scanners into elites or bosses
--katana enemies replace dodge anim with deflect and shoot bullet back
```
Implementation concept:
```lua
-- Example system for enhanced named NPCs
local function enhanceNamedNPC(npc)
    if npc.isNamed and npc.faction == "NCPD" then
        upgradeToElite(npc)
        addSpecialAbilities(npc)
        enhanceStats(npc)
    end
end

-- Example deflect system for katana users
local function setupKatanaDeflect(npc)
    if hasKatana(npc) then
        replaceAnimation("dodge", "deflect")
        addDeflectCallback(function(bullet)
            return createReturnProjectile(bullet)
        end)
    end
end
```

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these solutions or focus on specific implementation details? I can also suggest additional enhancements or alternative approaches to any of these issues.
