### Gameplay Questions

**How does leveling work in Cyberpunk THING?**
The world is unleveled, meaning some areas will be challenging until you've grown stronger. Explore Night City and build your skills naturally.

**Are there difficulty settings?**
Both experiences work with all game difficulty settings, but we recommend Very Hard for Cyberpunk THING for the intended experience.

**Can I add my own mods?**
Yes, but we strongly recommend against it unless you're experienced with mod conflicts. Join our Discord for compatibility assistance.

**How often do you update?**
We update after major game patches and periodically to incorporate important mod updates or fixes.
