# Summary

Changes the hardcoded shooting patterns of enemies. Enemies now shoot at you immediately and no longer have a delay in firing. They can fire as fast as you can. 

> No more breaks

#### Arbitrary delays begone. Make enemies what they always should have been

When enabled, your enemies will react faster when starting combat and will fire upon you without mercy. They are now trying to kill you.
