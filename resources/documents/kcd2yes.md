## Combat

The combat crosshair is now centered on the screen instead of being tied to the enemy. Moving your mouse/camera is how you switch targets if you are not locked on

Enemies attack more often and are less defensive, especially when Henry is outnumbered. Grouped enemies attack more often and may now attack Henry all at once. They will also surround Henry faster and can sprint to reposition during a fight.

Enemies will prioritize the Normal Block and Dodge maneuvers, and use Perfect Block and Riposte less

Enemies will react more quickly to feints or in the clinch

Enemies will change their stance and weapon position more often

You can now build up to being a truly powerful knight with changes to horse armor
