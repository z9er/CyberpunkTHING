# Welcome to Night City and Cyberpunk THING

Night City is full of hardened gangoons with hair triggers and bad attitudes. But they've never run into anything like you.

The future of modding is here. You shouldn't need a degree from Arasaka Academy just to be able to enjoy Cyberpunk 2077 with mods. We provide not one, but two fully tailored and preconfigured modded experiences crafted from the best mods our team and the community at large have to offer.

# Prerequisites

You must have a clean **Cyberpunk 2077** installation before installing this Wabbajack modlist, which you can ensure by doing the following:

### Ensuring Clean Game Install

1️⃣ Go to your **"appdata"** folder by searching windows and typing **%appdata%**

![appdata](https://i.imgur.com/ViAyUOX.png)

2️⃣ In **"AppData"** folder go to **"Local,"** and in this folder delete the **"CD Projekt Red"** and **"Red Engine"** folders to ensure there are no errors with the cached config files

3️⃣ Go to your main Cyberpunk 2077 directory and delete the **all** folders except for **"archive"**

```
If you've ever modded Cyberpunk before, it's important to ensure you have a clean game folder
```

4️⃣ Additionally delete the **"mod"** folder in **"Cyberpunk 2077/archive/pc/"**

5️⃣ Now make sure you go and verify your game files through **Steam**, **GOG** or **Epic**

6️⃣ Ensure the drive you wish to install the list to supports hard links

## Premium vs Non-Premium

For premium Nexus users installing this Wabbajack is a one click process

For non-premium users, the installation process is still simple. You just have to click **"Download"** followed by **"Slow Download"** as Wabbajack brings up buttons for every mod

# Using Wabbajack

### Preparations

Grab the latest release of Wabbajack from [here](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases) 

[![wjack readme 5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/wabbajack%20readme/wjack%20readme%205.png)](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases "Wabbajack Link")

[wjack readme 5 p2]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/wabbajack%20readme/wjack%20readme%205.png

Place the `Wabbajack.exe` in a location like `C:\Wabbajack`

```
Wabbajack can be installed to any folder as long as it is on the same hard drive as your Cyberpunk 2077 game directory
```

### Downloading and Installing

The download and installation process depends on
your system specs. Wabbajack will calculate the amount of threads it will use at
the start of the installation

To have the highest amount of threads and thus the fastest speed, it is advised to have the working folder on an SSD, this doesn't matter a huge deal for the modlist itself however it will matter when playing the game

1. Open Wabbajack
2. Load the Modlist by clicking **"Browse Modlists"** (selecting the Cyberpunk 2077) 
3. Set Cyberpunk THING to install to `C:\Cyberpunk THING` and downloads to `C:\Cyberpunk THING\Downloads`
   You can set a different path if you wish, but avoid system protected folders. 
   
```
Avoid installing the list to a system protected folder like Program Files, ensure the list is installed to a different location than the folder Wabbajack.exe is located in
```
   
4. Click the Go/Begin button
5. Wait for Wabbajack to finish

### Problems with Wabbajack

There are a lot of different scenarios where Wabbajack will produce an error.
If you do not see an installation failed warning do not worry about it. If you
feel like wabbajack is stuck or a download is hanging just restart wabbajack,
it will pick up from exactly where you left off

Please rerun wabbajack at least twice and try to manually download the file
from first before posting about a failed download

**Could not download x**

If a mod updated and the old files got deleted, it may be impossible to download
them. In this case just wait until there is a list update

**Wabbajack could not find my game folder**

You need to have launched the game once before WJ will locate it. The list works with the **GOG,** **Steam,** or **Epic** version of the game

# Starting the Game

Head over to the installation folder and locate an executable named
ModOrganizer.exe and launch it. Once its launched there will be a dropdown box
on the top right and a big run button next to it

```
Do not ever unlock MO2 while it says "locked," you will cause issues
```

### Switching Profiles

This modlist comes with two separately built experiences which can be changed by choosing either **Cyberpunk THING** or **Welcome to Night City** on the upper left side of Mod Organizer 2

### Getting Familiar with Mods

Some mods may have additional features that may not be immediately apparent, would recommend looking at the [Mod Functionality section of our FAQ](https://github.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/blob/main/FAQ.md#mod-functionality)

# Updating/Uninstalling

If this Modlist receives an update please check the Changelog before doing
anything. Always backup your saves or start a new game after updating

**Wabbajack will delete all files that are not part of the Modlist when updating!**

This means that any additional mods you have installed on top of the Modlist
will be deleted. Your downloads folder will not be touched! That means if you have made your own modded setup on top of the list, you should update those mods *manually*.

Updating is like installing. You only have to make sure that you select the same
path and tick the _overwrite existing Modlist_ button

### Reseting Night City Interactions

After an update, go to V's original apartment and into the stash room to reset NCI

![NCI Reset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/wabbajack%20readme/nci.PNG)

Then leave the apartment and reenter to complete the reset

### Removing the Modlist

You can just remove the MO2 folder, along with any Game Folder file mod you've installed and be done with it
