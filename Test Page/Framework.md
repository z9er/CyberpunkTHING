#### The future of modding is here. You shouldn't need a degree from Arasaka Academy just to be able to enjoy Cyberpunk 2077 with mods. We provide not one, but two fully tailored and preconfigured modded experiences made from the best mods our team and the community at large have to offer. 

![trailer](https://i.imgur.com/MV0Lbpu.png)

**A WORLD TO GET LOST IN**



Whether you're out at the club with your friends, hooking up with strangers, or reveling in the impact your latest rampage has had on the stock market, countless new additions transform Night City into the living, breathing metropolis you always imagined

**PLAY YOUR WAY**



With or without Phantom Liberty, enjoy two completely different experiences from one collection. Welcome to Night City brings the vanilla balance you know and love with all the best mods. Cyberpunk THING provides a more challenging and immersive approach with a focus on realism. Switch between them at any time for any reason

**OBSESSIVELY CURATED**


Stringently tested and preconfigured, we've made sure every mod is 100% compatible and tailored to give you the best possible combination of bug fixes, quality of life improvements and brand new features

**SIT BACK AND RELAX**


Unlike some other collections that take you on an unexpected journey of left turns and popups, we've made sure our installation is easy and painless. Truly a one click process for Premium Nexus Users (No Advanced Setup Here!)

**A COMMUNITY THAT CARES**


On both Discord and Nexus you can find our team actively answering questions, listening to your feedback and incorporating the community's suggestions into future revisions and mod projects

  One common cause for this is the **Wabbajack** client not being on the same hard drive as the game install, another is forgetting to have **Steam** or **GOG** verify and reacquire files as part of doing a cleaning of your Cyberpunk 2077 install

  In order to use the included mod [Simple Flashlight](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/2913) open the "Game Folder Files" folder in your modlist install location, and copy the archive folder into your main Cyberpunk 2077 directory

  <summary>Quests</summary>
  &#10240;
  
  To keep some of your custom mods when updating the **Wabbajack** rename the mods in **MO2** and add [NoDelete] on the left hand MO2 pane. As example "Dawn FM" becomes "[NoDelete] Dawn FM"

  <summary>Quality of Life and Bug Fixes</summary>
  &#10240;
  
  Launching the game through MO2 means that those rewards do not populate in your game as they have to go through CDPR's launcher. The easiest workaround is to in your new game run it without the modlist active (running through **GOG** or **Steam**), go through the prologue to your apartment and get the items, then launch the game through **MO2** to use the list after that

The uninstalled mod archives are left in the **"Mods"** list in bright blue, which you should delete

![Update Removing Old Mods step 2](https://i.imgur.com/OdfLQcO.png)

After an update, go to V's original apartment and into the stash room to reset Night City Interactions

![NCI Reset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/wabbajack%20readme/nci.PNG)

Then leave the apartment and reenter to complete the reset

```
Do not update any of the mods in the collection individually in Vortex! The philosophy of this collection is that when a 
mod updates, we update a full revision in order to keep everything up to date and interfacing correctly; when you see a 
new revision, update to it. If anything special is needed we will mention it in the changelog
```

</details>

<details><summary>CET Setup</summary>
## CET Setup

![spacer](https://i.imgur.com/42dA30s.png)

When you start the game for the first time you will be met with an overlay prompting you to choose a key to toggle on Cyber Engine Tweaks, recommend that you choose the **"~"** key for the **"Overlay Key"**

![First CET Popup](https://i.imgur.com/lgIR1mi.png)

The main **"Cyber Engine Tweaks"** window will now pop up, and on it you should click the **"Bindings"** button near the top left of the window

![CET Binding](https://i.imgur.com/HiLTXZA.png)

Recommend binding keys for **"BetterScopes",** **"CustomQuickslots",** **"NanoDrone",** and **"QuestTrackingToggle"** in the **"Bindings"** section that pops up

Below the section there is a **"Save"** button which you should click to save any changes

</details>

<details><summary>Quickslots Settings</summary>
## Quickslots Settings

![spacer](https://i.imgur.com/42dA30s.png)

In Cyberpunk, there is no way to bind multiple hotkeys for actions, items, or abilities, as each must be assigned through the menu to the one assignable hotkey at a time, leading to gameplay interruptions if you want to play well. [Custom Quickslots](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/3096) solves this issue by allowing bindable hotkeys which show up on the Native game UI and allow you up to 20 hotkeyed actions, abilities, or items. Some small setup is required

```
Navigating the Mods menu uses the arrows at the top to switch between the different pages of mods
```

After clicking **"Mods"** in the main menu, navigate to the **"QSLOTS"** section, recommend changing **"Other Consumable Item Mods Compatibility Mode,"** **"Hide empty consumable and grenade slots,"** **"Hide empty cyberware ability slots"** and **"Small item slots"** to **"On"**. Recommend changing **"Number of Custom Quickslots"** to **"0"** and then adding slots as needed during the course of gameplay.

```
This collection is built around the very hard difficulty setting
```

After clicking **"Settings"** in the main menu, near the left side of the top menu click on the **"GAMEPLAY"** section, recommend changing **"Aim Assist"** and **"Aim Assist - Melee Combat"** to **"Off"**

![Gameplay Recommended Settings Combined](https://i.imgur.com/mAUjyAW.png)

Near the right side of the top menu click on the **"INTERFACE"** section, recommend changing **"Damage Numbers Mode"** to **"Off,"** **"Overhead Damage Numbers"** to **"None,"** and **"Threat and Damage Indicator"** to **"Damage Only"**

![Interface Recommended Settings Combined](https://i.imgur.com/6JNViAW.png)

Further down in the **"HUD Visibility"** section, recommend keeping all on except **"Hints,"** **"Activity Log,"** and **"NPC Names"**

![Hud Visibility](https://i.imgur.com/zleClLA.png)

New players may want to keep "Hints" on until they feel they no longer need them

# Frequently Asked

Our [FAQ page](https://github.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/blob/main/FAQ.md) is a treasure trove of information that we’ve gathered from answering users' questions over time. If you have an issue, we highly recommend you check if it's already been answered. And if not, you can always find us on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/eJdMQKnQVt) :)

<details><summary>General Troubleshooting</summary>

<details><summary>Can I add this list to my existing save?</summary>
![a blank spacer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/collection/spacer.png)

**You can add this list to an existing vanilla save with no issues.** If you're adding this to a previously modded save, it would depend on the mods that were   associated. Sometimes mods that add items to the game through ArchiveXL can be baked into the save, and if that mod is no longer there, would cause the game to crash.

![a blank spacer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/collection/spacer.png)

In order for your [custom quickslots](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/3096) options to work, your choices that you bind in the **"Mods"** menu will need to be duplicated in CET. As an example of this, you would first choose a keybind and action for a quickslot by going to **"Mods"** on the left side of the main menu

![faq 14](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2014.png)

At the top, select **"QSLOTS"**

![faq 15](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2015.png)

Adjust **"Number of Custom Quickslots"** to be 1 or more

![faq 16](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2016.png)

In this example, selecting for **"food"** and selecting **"9"** as the keybind

![faq 17](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2017.png)

Press the key you chose to bind for the CET menu in order to open it, and go to **"Bindings"**

![faq 18](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2018.png)

Will want to duplicate the keybind for the same slot, which was Slot 1

![faq 19](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2019.png)

Then save the selection, and the quickslot you have chosen will now work

The reason this option is off in **"Mod Settings"**, **"LHUD ADDONS"** is if it is on, it allows certain keys to turn off all hud elements, which can be quite annoying on controller. If you would like to turn this on but want to change the keybind you will need to go to

This due to a known gamebug we fixed with the mod ToolTipsFixer. The mod is preadjusted for 16:9 but can be adjusted for other ratios.

!\[faq 33]\(INSERT MOD SETTINGS PNG HERE!! Z9 / B)

About settings:
Mod supports ingame configuring through Mod settings.
Mod switches over several scale levels depending tooltip content size.
On/Off settings switches do exactly what they descriptions says. One thing is: hiding evolution description and replacing 'crafted' module may help to get more useful space for tooltip text content and get a bit higher calculated scale for more readable text.
Scale offset - global offset value for each scale level. Use mostly for fine size tuning.
Scale multiplier - mult for each basic scale value (apply before scale offset). If lower scale levels make too small tooltips then this slider might help. Won't affect on basic (default) scale level.
Content limit offset - offset for tooltip size limit to change scale level. In other words - higher value will switch scaling level down earlier, and lower value - later.

This is often associated with the **Vortex Redmod Autoconversion** being toggled on. It is off by default, but if it has done the autoconversion you will need to go through a process to correct this, and you will not have to redownload the associated mods. Go to the left side of Vortex to the grey bar and click on **"Settings"**
