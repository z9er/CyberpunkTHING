<details><summary>Can I add this list to my existing save?</summary>
![a blank spacer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/collection/spacer.png)

**You can add this list to an existing vanilla save with no issues.** If you're adding this to a previously modded save, it would depend on the mods that were   associated. Sometimes mods that add items to the game through ArchiveXL can be baked into the save, and if that mod is no longer there, would cause the game to crash.

<details><summary>My game flatlines when opening with a redscript error</summary>
![a blank spacer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/collection/spacer.png)

**It's important to ensure that this list is installed onto a purely vanilla setup to avoid script errors and crashes from old mods.**

Go to your main Cyberpunk 2077 directory and delete the **all** folders except for **"archive"**

![faq 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%201.png)

Additionally delete the **"mod"** folder in **"Cyberpunk 2077/archive/pc/"**

![faq 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%202.png)

Now make sure you go and verify your game files through **Steam**, **GOG** or **Epic**

If you run into the error displayed above, you will want to disable cloud saves as that game setting can cause this issue.

On the left side of the main menu, click on **"Settings"**

![faq 6](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%206.png)

At the top click **"Gameplay"**

![faq 9](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%209.png)

If you run into the above issue where there is no way to remote activate a door or window, you will need to ensure that [Better Netrunning](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/2302) is correctly configured. On the left side of the main menu click on **"Mods"**

![faq 10](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2010.png)

Go to **"Better Netrunning"**

![faq 11](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2011.png)

Scroll down to the **"Access Points"** section and ensure that **"Unlock Networks With No Access Points"** is enabled

![faq 12](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2012.png)

This will correct the issue

<details><summary>My custom quickslots binds aren't working</summary>
![a blank spacer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/collection/spacer.png)

In order for your [custom quickslots](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/3096) options to work, your choices that you bind in the **"Mods"** menu will need to be duplicated in CET. As an example of this, you would first choose a keybind and action for a quickslot by going to **"Mods"** on the left side of the main menu

![faq 14](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2014.png)

At the top, select **"QSLOTS"**

![faq 15](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2015.png)

Adjust **"Number of Custom Quickslots"** to be 1 or more

![faq 16](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2016.png)

In this example, selecting for **"food"** and selecting **"9"** as the keybind

![faq 17](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2017.png)

Press the key you chose to bind for the CET menu in order to open it, and go to **"Bindings"**

![faq 18](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2018.png)

Will want to duplicate the keybind for the same slot, which was Slot 1

![faq 19](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2019.png)

Then save the selection, and the quickslot you have chosen will now work

You're sitting sharing a nice moment pondering the future's opportunities with Jackie at the food stand outside of your apartment, and you need to call the car in order to "feel the factory new ride". If your hints are disabled it won't tell you what to do, but you'll want to call your vehicle, default keybind is **"V"**

![faq 22](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2022.png)

The reason this option is off in **"Mod Settings"**, **"LHUD ADDONS"** is if it is on, it allows certain keys to turn off all hud elements, which can be quite annoying on controller. If you would like to turn this on but want to change the keybind you will need to go to

```
FOR VORTEX USERS
```

In your main Cyberpunk 2077 directory, navigate to **"r6\input"** and open **"LimitedHUD.xml**

This was a known issue with [Immersive Bartenders](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/7203) which has now been fixed, but could still be an issue on a save that was running a previous version.

This due to a known gamebug we fixed with the mod ToolTipsFixer. The mod is preadjusted for 16:9 but can be adjusted for other ratios.

!\[faq 33]\(INSERT MOD SETTINGS PNG HERE!! Z9 / B)

About settings:
Mod supports ingame configuring through Mod settings.
Mod switches over several scale levels depending tooltip content size.
On/Off settings switches do exactly what they descriptions says. One thing is: hiding evolution description and replacing 'crafted' module may help to get more useful space for tooltip text content and get a bit higher calculated scale for more readable text.
Scale offset - global offset value for each scale level. Use mostly for fine size tuning.
Scale multiplier - mult for each basic scale value (apply before scale offset). If lower scale levels make too small tooltips then this slider might help. Won't affect on basic (default) scale level.
Content limit offset - offset for tooltip size limit to change scale level. In other words - higher value will switch scaling level down earlier, and lower value - later.

This is often associated with the **Vortex Redmod Autoconversion** being toggled on. It is off by default, but if it has done the autoconversion you will need to go through a process to correct this, and you will not have to redownload the associated mods. Go to the left side of Vortex to the grey bar and click on **"Settings"**

![faq 33](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2033.png)

Go to the middle top grey bar and click on **"V2077 Settings"** and ensure that **"Automatically convert old style 'archive' mods to REDmods on install"** is greyed out and is not active

Left click on the mod at the top of the list in the middle of the screen to highlight it

![faq 37](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2037.png)

Scroll to the bottom mod in the list and shift + left click it in order to highlight all of the mods

![faq 38](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2038.png)

On the white bar that has appeared at the very bottom of the list click **"Remove"**

![faq 39](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2039.png)

In the popup that appears ensure that **"Remove Mod"** is ticked with a blue and white checkmark, but that **"Delete Archive"** remains unticked and clear

![faq 40](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2040.png)

Click **"Remove"** at the bottom right of the popup

![faq 41](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2041.png)

In the next popup, tick the box for **"Apply to Recommended Mods"** so that a blue and white checkmark appears

Then click on **"Disable"** bottom right of the grey popup

![faq 44](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2044.png)

The list of mods will now show as **"Uninstalled"** in blue

![faq 45](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2045.png)

Scroll down to the mod **"Cyberpunk Thing"** and left click it

![faq 46](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2046.png)

After highlighting **"Cyberpunk Thing"** right click it and left click **"Install"**

![faq 47](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2047.png)

In the popup that appears click **"Install Now"**

![faq 48](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2048.png)

These steps will undo the REDmod autoconversion that vortex performed and will correct your install without you having to redownload any mods
