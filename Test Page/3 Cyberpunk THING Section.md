# Cyberpunk THING (Maybe the cyberpunk thing logo here?)

Tired of the day-to-day in WTNC? Looking for more of a challenge? Cyberpunk THING offers a world more focused on immersion and realism, featuring a reduced (but sensible) HUD, more difficult and varied enemies, and more balanced cyberware options, just to name a few.

A bullet's a bullet, and Night City is full of hardened gangoons with hair triggers and bad attitudes. But they've never run into anything like you.
