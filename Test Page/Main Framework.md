#### The future of modding is here. You shouldn't need a degree from Arasaka Academy just to be able to enjoy Cyberpunk 2077 with mods. We provide not one, but two fully tailored and preconfigured modded experiences crafted from the best mods our team and the community at large have to offer.

## A WORLD TO GET LOST IN (THIS IS A PICTURE WITH THE WORDS THEN IMAGE ON RIGHT TO SPRUCE IT UP)

**A LIVING CITY**



Whether you're out at the club with your friends, hooking up with strangers, or reveling in the impact your latest rampage has had on the stock market, countless new additions transform Night City into the living, breathing metropolis you always imagined

**PLAY YOUR WAY**



With or without Phantom Liberty, enjoy two completely different experiences from one collection. Welcome to Night City brings the vanilla balance you know and love with all the best mods. Cyberpunk THING provides a more challenging and immersive approach with a focus on realism. Switch between them at any time for any reason

**OBSESSIVELY CURATED**


Stringently tested and preconfigured, we've ensured that every mod is 100% compatible and tailored to give you the best possible combination of bug fixes, quality-of-life improvements, and brand-new features

**SIT BACK AND RELAX**


Unlike some other collections that take you on an unexpected journey of left turns and popups, we've made sure our installation is easy and painless. Truly a one-click process for Premium Nexus Users (No Advanced Setup Here!)

**A COMMUNITY THAT CARES**


On both Discord and Nexus, you can find our team actively answering questions, listening to your feedback, and incorporating the community's suggestions into future revisions and mod projects

# Cyberpunk THING (Maybe the cyberpunk thing logo here?)

Tired of the day-to-day in WTNC? Looking for more of a challenge? Cyberpunk THING offers a world more focused on immersion and realism, featuring a reduced (but sensible) HUD, more difficult and varied enemies, and more balanced cyberware options, just to name a few.

A bullet's a bullet, and Night City is full of hardened gangoons with hair triggers and bad attitudes. But they've never run into anything like you.

# Install

This video guide will give you all the information you need in less than two minutes, or you can continue reading below.

# Installing Vortex

1️⃣ Ensure that you have installed Vortex if you haven't, which can be obtained [the link below](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/1?tab=files)

[![Vortex](https://i.imgur.com/xXhkzvj.png)](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/1?tab=files "Vortex download")

# Managing Cyberpunk

1️⃣ In the main Vortex Window, click on **"Select a game to manage"**

![Vortex First Steps 5](https://i.imgur.com/MQG9vBR.png)

2️⃣ On the next screen scroll down to the **"Cyberpunk 2077"** icon and, when mousing over it, click on **"Manage"** in orange

![Vortex First Steps 6](https://i.imgur.com/n9HwYPW.png)

3️⃣ On the popup that appears, click on **"Download"** on the bottom right in orange, after this Vortex will restart

![Vortex First Steps 7](https://i.imgur.com/C9vRW9M.png)

4️⃣ After Vortex restarts, a **"Game not discovered"** popup will appear, click **"Continue"** at the bottom right of the popup in orange

![Vortex First Steps 8](https://i.imgur.com/mBvyPrd.png)

5️⃣ A window will now pop up where you should choose the folder for your main **"Cyberpunk 2077"** install directory

6️⃣ Vortex will pop up a window titled **"REDmod DLC missing"** on which you should click **"Ignore"**

![REDmod first BS popup](https://i.imgur.com/mY9T3Aw.png)

7️⃣ Go to **"Settings"** on the left, then go to **"V2077 Settings"** and ensure that **"Automically convert old style 'archive' mods to REDmods on install"** is turned off

```
This setting is defaulted to off by default unless you had changed it
```

![redmod bullshit](https://i.imgur.com/rTip1CM.png)

8️⃣ Go to **"Settings""** on the left, then go to the **"Mods"** section and ensure the deployment method is **"Hardlink Deployment"**

```
If you are on a drive that does not allow hard links due to the formatting, you may need to reformat your drive. This can happen with FAT or XFAT formatting and the only solution is changing the drive format
```

![hardlink thing](https://i.imgur.com/iSMkrcz.png)

# Installing Collection

1️⃣ On the **[collection page](https://next.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/collections/iszwwe)** click on **"ADD TO VORTEX,"** then click **"Install Now"** when that pops up in Vortex

# Cleaning Vortex

1️⃣ Go to **"Settings"** on the left, then go to **"V2077 Settings"** and ensure that **"Automically convert old style 'archive' mods to REDmods on install"** is turned off

```
This setting is defaulted to off by default unless you had changed it

```

![hardlink thing](https://i.imgur.com/iSMkrcz.png)

3️⃣ Ensure that you have removed any old mods that may be hardlinked into your main game folder from the **"Mods"** section of Vortex, and check if you have any additional Cyberpunk 2077 profiles that have mods that were hardlinked into your maingame folder. Any of this could interfere with the collection working properly due to redundant/old mods

# Ensuring Clean Game Install

1️⃣ Go to your **"appdata"** folder by searching windows typing **%appdata%**

![appdata](https://i.imgur.com/ViAyUOX.png)

2️⃣ In **"AppData"** folder go to **"Local,"** and in this folder delete the **"CD Projekt Red"** and **"Red Engine"** folders

![appdata delete](https://i.imgur.com/egu0d8A.png)

3️⃣ Go to your main Cyberpunk 2077 directory and delete the **all** folders except for **"archive"**

```
If you've ever modded Cyberpunk before, it's important to ensure you have a clean game folder
```

![Clean Install 1](https://i.imgur.com/AXG7U40.png)

4️⃣ Additionally delete the **"mod"** folder in **"Cyberpunk 2077/archive/pc/"**

![Clean Install 2](https://i.imgur.com/YW0s73X.png)

5️⃣ Now make sure you go and verify your game files through **Steam**, **GOG** or **Epic**

## Premium vs Non-Premium

For premium Nexus users installing this collection is a one click process as below

![premium gif picture](https://i.imgur.com/vhecJdw.png)

For non-premium users, the installation process is still simple. You just have to click **"Download"** followed by **"Slow Download"** as Vortex brings up buttons for every mod in the collection.

# Frequently Asked

Our [FAQ page](https://github.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/blob/main/FAQ.md) is a treasure trove of information that we’ve gathered from answering users' questions over time. If you have an issue, we highly recommend you check if it's already been answered. And if not, you can always find us on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/eJdMQKnQVt) :)

<details><summary>General Troubleshooting</summary>
![spacer](https://i.imgur.com/42dA30s.png)

<details><summary>Can I add this list to my existing save?</summary>
![a blank spacer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/collection/spacer.png)

**You can add this list to an existing vanilla save with no issues.** If you're adding this to a previously modded save, it would depend on the mods that were   associated. Sometimes mods that add items to the game through ArchiveXL can be baked into the save, and if that mod is no longer there, would cause the game to crash.

![faq 18](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2018.png)

Will want to duplicate the keybind for the same slot, which was Slot 1

![faq 19](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2019.png)

This due to a known gamebug we fixed with the mod ToolTipsFixer. The mod is preadjusted for 16:9 but can be adjusted for other ratios.

!\[faq 33]\(INSERT MOD SETTINGS PNG HERE!! Z9 / B)

About settings:
Mod supports ingame configuring through Mod settings.
Mod switches over several scale levels depending tooltip content size.
On/Off settings switches do exactly what they descriptions says. One thing is: hiding evolution description and replacing 'crafted' module may help to get more useful space for tooltip text content and get a bit higher calculated scale for more readable text.
Scale offset - global offset value for each scale level. Use mostly for fine size tuning.
Scale multiplier - mult for each basic scale value (apply before scale offset). If lower scale levels make too small tooltips then this slider might help. Won't affect on basic (default) scale level.
Content limit offset - offset for tooltip size limit to change scale level. In other words - higher value will switch scaling level down earlier, and lower value - later.

This is often associated with the **Vortex Redmod Autoconversion** being toggled on. It is off by default, but if it has done the autoconversion you will need to go through a process to correct this, and you will not have to redownload the associated mods.
