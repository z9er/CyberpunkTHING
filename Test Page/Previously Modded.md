# Cleaning Vortex

**1)** Go to **"Settings"** on the left, then go to **"V2077 Settings"** and ensure that **"Automically convert old style 'archive' mods to REDmods on install"** is turned off

```
This setting is defaulted to off by default unless you had changed it
```

**2)** Go to **"Settings""** on the left, then go to the **"Mods"** section and ensure the deployment method is **"Hardlink Deployment"**

```
If you are on a drive that does not allow hard links due to the formatting, you may need to reformat your drive. This can happen with FAT or XFAT formatting and the only solution is changing the drive format
```

**3)** Ensure that you have removed any old mods that may be hardlinked into your main game folder from the **"Mods"** section of Vortex, and check if you have any additional Cyberpunk 2077 profiles that have mods that were hardlinked into your maingame folder. Any of this could interfere with the collection working properly due to redundant/old mods

# Ensuring Clean Game Install

**1)** Go to your **"appdata"** folder by searching windows typing **%appdata%**

**3)** Go to your main Cyberpunk 2077 directory and delete the **all** folders except for **"archive"**

```
If you've ever modded Cyberpunk before, it's important to ensure you have a clean game folder
```
