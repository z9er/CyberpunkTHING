**5)** A window will now pop up where you should choose the folder for your main **"Cyberpunk 2077"** install directory

**6)** Vortex will pop up a window titled **"REDmod DLC missing"** on which you should click **"Ignore"**

**7)** Go to **"Settings""** on the left, then go to the **"Mods"** section and ensure the deployment method is **"Hardlink Deployment"**

```
If you are on a drive that does not allow hard links due to the formatting, you may need to reformat your drive. This can happen with FAT or XFAT formatting and the only solution is changing the drive format
