#### The aim is to make Cyberpunk the game it was always intended to be. More immersive, more realistic. A bullet's a bullet, and Night City is full of hardened gangoons with hair triggers and bad attitudes. But they've never run into anything like you.

#### More than just a collection of other modders' amazing work, we are actively developing new mods to add gameplay elements that support our vision. We provide a fully preconfigured and easy to use modded experience; it just works, plug n' play.

```

If you have installed the **REDmod DLC**, go to the [cybercmd page at the link below](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/5176?tab=files)

[![cybercmd](https://i.imgur.com/QKHJlGJ.png)](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/5176?tab=files "cybercmd download")

# Updating Collection

![spacer](https://i.imgur.com/42dA30s.png)

Updating the collection is as easy as clicking the **"Update"** button

![Update](https://i.imgur.com/8UDf7uP.png)

When prompted to **"Remove mods from old revision"** make sure to click the **"Remove All"** button

![Update Removing Old Mods](https://i.imgur.com/8RzrQPh.png)

The uninstalled mod archives are left in the **"Mods"** list in bright blue, which you should delete

![Update Removing Old Mods step 2](https://i.imgur.com/OdfLQcO.png)

```
Do not update any of the mods in the collection individually in Vortex! The philosophy of this collection is that when a mod updates, we update a full revision in order to keep everything up to date and interfacing correctly; when you see a new revision, update to it. If anything special is needed we will mention it in the changelog
```

# CET Setup

![spacer](https://i.imgur.com/42dA30s.png)

When you start the game for the first time you will be met with an overlay prompting you to choose a key to toggle on Cyber Engine Tweaks, recommend that you choose the **"~"** key for the **"Overlay Key"**

![First CET Popup](https://i.imgur.com/lgIR1mi.png)

The main **"Cyber Engine Tweaks"** window will now pop up, and on it you should click the **"Bindings"** button near the top left of the window

![CET Binding](https://i.imgur.com/HiLTXZA.png)

Recommend binding keys for **"BetterScopes",** **"CustomQuickslots",** **"NanoDrone",** and **"QuestTrackingToggle"** in the **"Bindings"** section that pops up

Below the section there is a **"Save"** button which you should click to save any changes

![Save](https://i.imgur.com/F4yPsJB.png)

![spacer](https://i.imgur.com/42dA30s.png)

# Quickslots Settings

![spacer](https://i.imgur.com/42dA30s.png)

In Cyberpunk, there is no way to bind multiple hotkeys for actions, items, or abilities, as each must be assigned through the menu to the one assignable hotkey at a time, leading to gameplay interruptions if you want to play well. [Custom Quickslots](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/3096) solves this issue by allowing bindable hotkeys which show up on the Native game UI and allow you up to 20 hotkeyed actions, abilities, or items. Some small setup is required

```
Navigating the Mods menu uses the arrows at the top to switch between the different pages of mods
```

After clicking **"Mods"** in the main menu, navigate to the **"QSLOTS"** section, recommend changing **"Other Consumable Item Mods Compatibility Mode,"** **"Hide empty consumable and grenade slots,"** **"Hide empty cyberware ability slots"** and **"Small item slots"** to **"On"**. Recommend changing **"Number of Custom Quickslots"** to **"0"** and then adding slots as needed during the course of gameplay.

# Recommended Game Settings

![spacer](https://i.imgur.com/42dA30s.png)

```
This collection is built around the very hard difficulty setting
```

After clicking **"Settings"** in the main menu, near the left side of the top menu click on the **"GAMEPLAY"** section, recommend changing **"Aim Assist"** and **"Aim Assist - Melee Combat"** to **"Off"**

![Gameplay Recommended Settings Combined](https://i.imgur.com/mAUjyAW.png)

Near the right side of the top menu click on the **"INTERFACE"** section, recommend changing **"Damage Numbers Mode"** to **"Off,"** **"Overhead Damage Numbers"** to **"None,"** and **"Threat and Damage Indicator"** to **"Damage Only"**

![Interface Recommended Settings Combined](https://i.imgur.com/6JNViAW.png)

Further down in the **"HUD Visibility"** section, recommend keeping all on except **"Hints,"** **"Activity Log,"** and **"NPC Names"**

![Hud Visibility](https://i.imgur.com/zleClLA.png)

```
New players may want to keep "Hints" on until they feel they no longer need them
```

# Adjusted Mod Configuration

![spacer](https://i.imgur.com/42dA30s.png)

Several mods in the collection have been adjusted with permission from their mod authors. You are limited to using the **Techdeck** from [Drone Companions](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4520) as an alternative to a cyberdeck rather than something that can be run in tandem. The movement changes from [Alternate Midair Movement and Walljumping](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/5160) are now part of the **Maneuvering System** cyberware.
