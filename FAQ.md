## Crashes

<details>
  <summary>My game crashes on startup/loading save/I have a script error, what is the ultimate fix that will solve all my problems most of the time?</summary>
  &#10240;
  
Go side of Vortex and on the grey bar and click on **"Settings"**

![Redmod 1](https://i.imgur.com/ilpBWRY.png)

In the middle top of Vortex click on **"V2077 Settings"** and ensure that **"Automatically convert old-style 'archive' mods to REDmods on install"** is greyed out and not active

![Redmod 2](https://i.imgur.com/iSYsHmn.png)

![Redmod 3](https://i.imgur.com/nhjRZnF.png)

Left click on the grey part of any mod on the list in the mods section of Vortex to highlight the mod

![test1](https://i.imgur.com/dQX1fI9.png)

Now hit Control + A to highlight all mods and bring up a white bar at the bottom of Vortex. On this bar click Remove on the left side of it

![test2](https://i.imgur.com/AEc8cwh.png)

On the popup that comes up, ensure that delete archives checkbox is Not Ticked, and then click the orange Remove button on the bottom right

![test3](https://i.imgur.com/pI1ojet.png)

You will now see all the mods uninstalled and in blue in Vortex. If you see this, close out of Vortex.

![test4](https://i.imgur.com/mbWyDJX.png)

Go to your main Cyberpunk 2077 directory and delete the **all** folders except for **"archive"**

![tes5](https://i.imgur.com/AXG7U40.png)

Additionally delete the **"mod"** folder in **"Cyberpunk 2077/archive/pc/"**

![tes6](https://i.imgur.com/YW0s73X.png)

Now make sure you go and verify your game files through **Steam**, **GOG** or **Epic** so that it will reacquire the missing game files and get you back to a vanilla install, clearing the script error. Once the files are installed by your launcher, go to the website for the collection and add it to Vortex

![tes8](https://i.imgur.com/TLBR53V.png)

It will now install using the archives you had previously, so it won't need to download anything.

- Clicking on any item will activate outfit mode, which applies the visuals of the selected items to your character over equipped gear
- To equip item in another slot, move cursor over the item and hold displayed hotkey (F on keyboard)
- To unequip all currently equipped items, move cursor over the preview puppet and press displayed hotkey (X on keyboard)
- On the left side of the screen, you will see a list of your outfits
- The "Save outfit" button becomes available when outfit mode is active
- To equip a previously saved outfit, just click on the name in the list
- To delete an outfit, hover over the outfit and press the hotkey from the hint (X on keyboard)

<details>
  <summary>How do I use Idle Anywhere?</summary>
  &#10240;
  
Visit V's starting apartment in H10. You only need to do this once to 'activate' the mod.
Press the Sprint input while the following is true:

- Stood still (not sat, or crouched)
- Not in a moving elevator (probably can't be vehicle surf either)
- Out of combat
- Have empty hands
- Not looking directly up or down
- Not scanning (zooming is okay)

Press Sprint again to manually hide it.

The menu will also not work when controlling surveilance systems, in Brain Dances, and shouldn't work in Johnny's memories either.
If you do have/use the option while in conversation with NPCs just be aware that it can sometimes cause NPCs to sound distant/quiet during the animation(s)

  <summary>How do I use the Limited Hud global toggles?</summary>
  &#10240;
  
The mods adds two additional in-game hotkeys which you can use to toggle widgets visibility:

**Global Toggle:** global hotkey which you can use to toggle visibility for any module combination by your choice. By default it toggles Minimap, Quest Tracker and Quest Markers modules (**F8** by default).

**Minimap Toggle:** a separate hotkey to toggle minimap visibility (**F6** by default)

<details>
  <summary>What are Quickhack Loadouts all about?</summary>
  &#10240;

Lets you set up to 5 Quickhack loadouts for your Cyberdeck with an easy to use interface in the cyberdeck equip menu. Give each loadout a custom name; save and load loadouts at any time. This mod relieves the frustration of slowly changing your equipped quickhacks every time you want to switch from combat hacks to stealth, or whatever it is you need. There are 5 loadout slots. You can rename the title of each slot by clicking on the title and typing with a keyboard.

### Saving

When you click the "Save" button, the currently equipped quickhacks are saved to that loadout, and the current name of the loadout is saved. If you save while there are no loadouts equipped, an empty loadout is saved. Saved loadouts can be overwritten, including with an empty loadout.

### Loading

When you click the "Load" button, the quickhacks stored in that loadout are equipped. If there are no quickhacks stored in the loadout, then the Load button will be disabled. When you hover over a Load button, a tooltip displays the quickhacks in the loadout.

## General Troubleshooting

<details>
  <summary>Can I add this list to my existing save?</summary>
  &#10240;
  
  **You can add this list to an existing vanilla save with no issues.** If you're adding this to a previously modded save, it would depend on the mods that were   associated. Sometimes mods that add items to the game through ArchiveXL can be baked into the save, and if that mod is no longer there, would cause the game to crash.

  <summary>My custom quickslots binds aren't working</summary>
  &#10240;
  
  In order for your [custom quickslots](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/3096) options to work, your choices that you bind in the **"Mods"** menu will need to be duplicated in CET. As an example of this, you would first choose a keybind and action for a quickslot by going to **"Mods"** on the left side of the main menu
  
  ![faq 14](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2014.png)
  
  At the top, select **"QSLOTS"**
  
  ![faq 15](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2015.png)
  
  Adjust **"Number of Custom Quickslots"** to be 1 or more
  
  ![faq 16](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2016.png)

  ![faq 17](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2017.png)
  
  Press the key you chose to bind for the CET menu in order to open it, and go to **"Bindings"**
  
  ![faq 18](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2018.png)
  
  Will want to duplicate the keybind for the same slot, which was Slot 1
  
  ![faq 19](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2019.png)
  
  Then save the selection, and the quickslot you have chosen will now work

## Vortex Specific Troubleshooting

<details>
  <summary>I cannot see the mod settings menu ingame</summary>
  &#10240;
  
  This is often associated with the **Vortex Redmod Autoconversion** being toggled on. It is off by default, but if it has done the autoconversion you will need to go through a process to correct this, and you will not have to redownload the associated mods. Go to the left side of Vortex to the grey bar and click on **"Settings"**
  
  ![faq 33](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2033.png)
  
Go to the middle top grey bar and click on **"V2077 Settings"** and ensure that **"Automatically convert old style 'archive' mods to REDmods on install"** is greyed out and is not active
  
  ![faq 34](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2034.png)
  
  ![faq 35](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2035.png)
  
Go to the left hand side of vortex and click on **"Mods"** on the grey bar
  
  ![faq 36](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2036.png)
  
 Left click on the mod at the top of the list in the middle of the screen to highlight it
  
  ![faq 37](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2037.png)
  
Scroll to the bottom mod in the list and shift + left click it in order to highlight all of the mods
  
  ![faq 38](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2038.png)
  
  On the white bar that has appeared at the very bottom of the list click **"Remove"**
  
  ![faq 39](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2039.png)
  
  In the popup that appears ensure that **"Remove Mod"** is ticked with a blue and white checkmark, but that **"Delete Archive"** remains unticked and clear
  
  ![faq 40](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2040.png)
  
 Click **"Remove"** at the bottom right of the popup 
  
  ![faq 41](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2041.png)
  
 In the next popup, tick the box for **"Apply to Recommended Mods"** so that a blue and white checkmark appears 
  
  ![faq 42](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2042.png)
  
  ![faq 43](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2043.png)
  
Then click on **"Disable"** bottom right of the grey popup  
  
  ![faq 44](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2044.png)
  
The list of mods will now show as **"Uninstalled"** in blue
  
  ![faq 45](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2045.png)
  
Scroll down to the mod **"Cyberpunk Thing"** and left click it 
  
  ![faq 46](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2046.png)
  
  After highlighting **"Cyberpunk Thing"** right click it and left click **"Install"**
  
  ![faq 47](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2047.png)
  
  In the popup that appears click **"Install Now"**
  
  ![faq 48](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2048.png)
  
 These steps will undo the REDmod autoconversion that vortex performed and will correct your install without you having to redownload any mods

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Wabbajack can't find Cyberpunk 2077</summary>
  &#10240;
  
  One common cause for this is the **Wabbajack** client not being on the same hard drive as the game install, another is forgetting to have **Steam** or **GOG** verify and reacquire files as part of doing a cleaning of your Cyberpunk 2077 install
  
  &#10240;
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Mods I added disappeared on update</summary>
  &#10240;
  
  To keep some of your custom mods when updating the **Wabbajack** rename the mods in **MO2** and add [NoDelete] on the left hand MO2 pane. As example "Dawn FM" becomes "[NoDelete] Dawn FM"
