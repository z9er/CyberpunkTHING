## General Troubleshooting

<details>
  <summary>Can I add this list to my existing save?</summary>
  &#10240;
  
  **You can add this list to an existing vanilla save with no issues.** If you're adding this to a previously modded save, it would depend on the mods that were   associated. Sometimes mods that add items to the game through ArchiveXL can be baked into the save, and if that mod is no longer there, would cause the game to crash.

<details>
  <summary>My game flatlines when opening with a redscript error</summary>
  &#10240;
  
  **It's important to ensure that this list is installed onto a purely vanilla setup to avoid script errors and crashes from old mods.**
  
  Go to your main Cyberpunk 2077 directory and delete the **all** folders except for **"archive"**

![faq 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%201.png)

Additionally delete the **"mod"** folder in **"Cyberpunk 2077/archive/pc/"** 

![faq 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%202.png)

Now make sure you go and verify your game files through **Steam**, **GOG** or **Epic**

<details>
  <summary>I don't see the initial CET keybind popup</summary>
  &#10240;
  
  Go to your main **Cyberpunk 2077 directory** to **"bin/x64/plugins/cyber_engine_tweaks"** and delete **"bindings.json"**, then restart the game.

  ![faq 5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%205.png)
  
  If you run into the error displayed above, you will want to disable cloud saves as that game setting can cause this issue.
  
  On the left side of the main menu, click on **"Settings"**

  <summary>My custom quickslots binds aren't working</summary>
  &#10240;
  
  In order for your [custom quickslots](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/3096) options to work, your choices that you bind in the **"Mods"** menu will need to be duplicated in CET. As an example of this, you would first choose a keybind and action for a quickslot by going to **"Mods"** on the left side of the main menu
  
  ![faq 14](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2014.png)
  
  At the top, select **"QSLOTS"**
  
  ![faq 15](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2015.png)
  
  Adjust **"Number of Custom Quickslots"** to be 1 or more
  
  ![faq 16](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2016.png)
  
  In this example, selecting for **"food"** and selecting **"9"** as the keybind
  
  ![faq 17](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2017.png)
  
  Press the key you chose to bind for the CET menu in order to open it, and go to **"Bindings"**
  
  ![faq 18](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2018.png)
  
  Will want to duplicate the keybind for the same slot, which was Slot 1
  
  ![faq 19](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2019.png)
  
  Then save the selection, and the quickslot you have chosen will now work

  You're sitting sharing a nice moment pondering the future's opportunities with Jackie at the food stand outside of your apartment, and you need to call the car in order to "feel the factory new ride". If your hints are disabled it won't tell you what to do, but you'll want to call your vehicle, default keybind is **"V"**

  &#10240;
  
  This is associated with a **Reshade** version issue. As this list does not include and is not tested for any reshade, adding one is at your own risk, and this is one of a multitude of issues that can arise in using one

## Vortex Specific Troubleshooting

<details>
  <summary>I cannot see the mod settings menu ingame</summary>
  &#10240;
  
  This is often associated with the **Vortex Redmod Autoconversion** being toggled on. It is off by default, but if it has done the autoconversion you will need to go through a process to correct this, and you will not have to redownload the associated mods. Go to the left side of Vortex to the grey bar and click on **"Settings"**
  
  ![faq 33](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2033.png)
  
Go to the middle top grey bar and click on **"V2077 Settings"** and ensure that **"Automatically convert old style 'archive' mods to REDmods on install"** is greyed out and is not active
  
  ![faq 34](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2034.png)
  
  ![faq 35](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2035.png)
  
Go to the left hand side of vortex and click on **"Mods"** on the grey bar
  
  ![faq 36](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2036.png)
  
 Left click on the mod at the top of the list in the middle of the screen to highlight it
  
  ![faq 37](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2037.png)
  
Scroll to the bottom mod in the list and shift + left click it in order to highlight all of the mods
  
  ![faq 38](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2038.png)
  
  On the white bar that has appeared at the very bottom of the list click **"Remove"**
  
  ![faq 39](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2039.png)
  
  In the popup that appears ensure that **"Remove Mod"** is ticked with a blue and white checkmark, but that **"Delete Archive"** remains unticked and clear
  
  ![faq 40](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2040.png)
  
 Click **"Remove"** at the bottom right of the popup 
  
  ![faq 41](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2041.png)
  
 In the next popup, tick the box for **"Apply to Recommended Mods"** so that a blue and white checkmark appears 
  
  ![faq 42](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2042.png)
  
  ![faq 43](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2043.png)
  
Then click on **"Disable"** bottom right of the grey popup  
  
  ![faq 44](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2044.png)
  
The list of mods will now show as **"Uninstalled"** in blue
  
  ![faq 45](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2045.png)
  
Scroll down to the mod **"Cyberpunk Thing"** and left click it 
  
  ![faq 46](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2046.png)
  
  After highlighting **"Cyberpunk Thing"** right click it and left click **"Install"**
  
  ![faq 47](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2047.png)
  
  In the popup that appears click **"Install Now"**
  
  ![faq 48](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/FAQ/faq%2048.png)
  
 These steps will undo the REDmod autoconversion that vortex performed and will correct your install without you having to redownload any mods

## Wabbajack Specific Troubleshooting

<details>
  <summary>I don't see the initial CET keybind popup</summary>
  &#10240;
  
  In **MO2**, right click on **"CT Config"** in the left hand panel and select **"Open in Explorer"** and go to **"Root/bin/x64/plugins/cyber_engine_tweaks"** and delete **"bindings.json"**, then restart the game.

<details>
  <summary>Wabbajack can't find Cyberpunk 2077</summary>
  &#10240;
  
  One common cause for this is the **Wabbajack** client not being on the same hard drive as the game install, another is forgetting to have **Steam** or **GOG** verify and reacquire files as part of doing a cleaning of your Cyberpunk 2077 install
  
  &#10240;
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>My flashlight isn't working</summary>
  &#10240;
  
  In order to use the included mod [Simple Flashlight](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/2913) open the "Game Folder Files" folder in your modlist install location, and copy the archive folder into your main Cyberpunk 2077 directory

  &#10240;
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Mods I added disappeared on update</summary>
  &#10240;
  
  To keep some of your custom mods when updating the **Wabbajack** rename the mods in **MO2** and add [NoDelete] on the left hand MO2 pane. As example "Dawn FM" becomes "[NoDelete] Dawn FM"
  
   &#10240;
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>I can't get my preorder rewards</summary>
  &#10240;
  
  Launching the game through MO2 means that those rewards do not populate in your game as they have to go through CDPR's launcher. The easiest workaround is to in your new game run it without the modlist active (running through **GOG** or **Steam**), go through the prologue to your apartment and get the items, then launch the game through **MO2** to use the list after that

  <summary>I can't see enemies through walls with ping</summary>
  &#10240;
  
  This is a purposeful balance adjustment accomplished with the included mod [Disable Highlighting Through Walls,](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/3314) as without it ping can lead to extreme ease combined with tech weapons, and makes stealth far less rewarding. You are still able to manually mark enemies either yourself or through the [Nano Drone](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/3419) and this mark will show through walls
